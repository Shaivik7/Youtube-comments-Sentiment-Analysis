and you know, these days, all the security issues are really important, so you really need to take that into account and train for it too.... (ah yes, that's true, we call that devseccops).....

I would actually like to make a personal full-stack project that uses React, Nodejs, Express and MSSQL Server, along with the technologies mentioned in this video like caching, containerization, nginx, etc. in order to develop my backend skills (I already know React). Does anyone know any such project tutorial video/playlist/course, which would be complex enough to understand the nitty-gritty of these technologies? I would really appreciate it if you guys can help out a fellow developer to switch from Frontend to Full-stack development. It's okay if it might involves spending some amount of money on Cloud, hosting fees, etc. while building the project, because I'm guessing if I only build the application in my local machine, that won't be enough. I need to actually deploy it to the cloud to understand these technologies in depth.	2024-03-18T06:08:58Z	Neutral

The security responsibility is not true. It's a speciality, and highly complex to keep up with, or know how to test on it (e.g. pen tests, white-hat hacking). NEVER let developers be in charge of this.
Server maintenance isn't one either, it's for sysadmins to do. (a properly operated business has speciality dividing by roles: sysadmins, netadmins, security department, backend dev, frontend dev, project leads, management, DB engineers/admins, cloud engineers, etc etc etc) Each role knows their field of expertise, don't become a jack of all trades, but a master of none type of person.

You have to manage the data, set up and manage the server, be responsible for server security, design the application, code the application, test the application, maintain the source code for the  application, roll out the application, patch the application (a smaller version of test/design/test/check-in/roll-out/test again), scale the application and be on-call 24/7 to keep the application running smoothly.

Eventually you will get an understanding of technologies and vocabulary connected with a field of programming that you are interested in. Maybe its nto fastest way. Full learn bootcamp are propably the fastest but they just cost too much. They will often give you job and if you are willing to change your current job to programming that can be a good investment. Otherwise i would suggest to do something. You will get irritated often about not understanding or knowing something but you have to get used to it i guess.	2024-03-11T16:22:45Z	Positive

The problem isn't that the information isn't out there.. it's that there's SO MUCH and you're overwhelmed with where to start and what's even necessary for the thing you're trying to learn.. I'm not trying to learn everything about 15 languages and go relearn all of statistics and math; I just want to know what portions are relevant to a more narrow subject matter 

Ex1: Robotics and maybe machine vision or machine learning? - you need these principles and here are different languages or otherwise that can be interchanged.

Ex2: want to learn how to do data handling, visualization, and automating manual digital tasks? Do x,y,z..

Ex3: want to learn some local AI stuff, feeding proprietary documentation, schematics, and train your own LLM or otherwise for helping generate technical diagnostics instructions...? Do X,Y,Z"	2024-03-11T14:44:23Z	Neutral

I was a complete beginner to backend programming going to this having some basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Up to the JS game part, it was basically nothing new to me, but it was fun way to practice what I learnt, and I was feeling confident, that they are really starting from scratch. When the frontend part came in, it was still ok, but I had to google something about fetching and async code. But when the instructor of backend part started basically copy-pasting the code that was completely new to me and only somewhat explaing snippets of it, I was basically done and went to a different Node.js course.
So in summary, I find this course super imbalanced. It may suit to someone who knows all of it and only needs to revisit the skills as a reminder. But I don't think that many people with zero knowledge of HTML CSS and JS (which are targeted at the beginning) are going to fully understand the explanation at the end of the course. If it was divided into two seperate courses maybe it would make more sense."	2024-04-11T10:39:28Z	Neutral

 In short :

const newDiv = document.createElement(""div""); // creating DOM element
        newDiv.classList.add(""card""); // add class if we need it to wrapper
        newDiv.innerHTML = `
        <img class=""thumbnail"" src=""${IMG_PATH + item.poster_path}"" alt="""" />
        <h3 class=""movie-title"">${item.original_title}</h3>`; // implementing html to div that we created
        main.appendChild(newDiv); // inserting that div already with edited html in DOM

You can insert that code in your forEach/map method, just edit your variables.

Now, I am going to lay my weary head to rest, and I won't cry no more.  That was an ordeal of great magnitude.  This part of the course was not structured well, and while I finally got to grips with what the code was doing and can understand it in part, I did not ""LEARN"" how I would use it in a project I create - it would've been far better to 1. learn how to set up the database - 2. then place a single entry.   Then 3, after that read the entry back.  4. update it - doing each section in sections testing and debugging as we went along.  Really getting to grips with the very basics on using an online database before doing anything else.  Rather than being hit over the head with a completed solution that we just type in and hope there are not too many errors. This would give us bite sized chunks of code and checkpoints to test code making it far easier to debug - at one point I was about to give up because nothing was going through to the database it wasn't until I saw the errors pop up on the console when I stopped the code running that I had a chance - up to that point everything was saying it was a success and nothing was going to the database.  That how I would handle this lesson but what would I know, I am just an Instructor in Martial arts.  I was rather disappointed with this section after a superb section on JavaScript - even that lesson would've been better breaking it into smaller sections to avoid that dreaded parser error in line 57.  Also the deprecation warning took me aback how long will it be before the useNewUrlParser fails to work?  Leaving the course broken.  Does anyone know what I should use instead?"	2023-10-20T20:31:13Z	Neutral

334	2023-09-05T18:00:47Z	@yannickstommel2366	nu_pCVPKzTk	Overall i think this is a nice tutorial. Although in my opinion many important aspects do not get explained pretty good by Tomi. Some code is just written down without further explanation and there are also some parts that are written in a weird or unpractical style. For example: I would have loved to see how this API setup is really working and set up in the background. The API request we set up returns an object that contains all the movies with all the properties and you can see all of that in the console when we print the object. This would've made it much easier to understand, where the properties come from that you just copy pasted. Also an explanation where the API constants are found on the Website (APILINK, IMG_PATH, etc.). I eventually figured it all out by myself, which is fine though, but this way many people won't be able to reproduce this by their own. I think this tutorial is still good, i just wanted to point that out, because i haven't seen anyone complain about it. Keep it up.	2023-09-05T18:00:46Z	Positive

@6:16:37, Beau accesses a webview through replit (some URL like https://review-backend .. etc) and is able to append ""/api/v1/reviews"" to see ""hello world"".

But I am working in VS Code.  I've got everything configured correctly I think (I am getting our ""listening on port"" message), but I don't understand how to get a similar web view or URL.  Using the Live Server extension, I can pull up the file/directory as localhost, but it's just a directory/bunch of files -- I don't see a way to get it to show 'hello world' by manipulating the IP or URL.  How can I get a similar view and see 'hello world' using VS Code?"	2022-12-22T00:57:14Z	Neutral

I’ve graduated in CS last year and since then got an internship that got extended to 8 months and 2 contract jobs, one part time and another one full time but after this past July haven’t gotten anything. I was forced to work in customer service but kept applying every single day and practicing as well. Just last week a hospital gave me the “yes” after 4 interviews as Web Developer in JS but I’ll also see php, wordpress, drupal from some of their sites, SQL and work on integrations. Yesterday I had a meeting with HR and webt through benefits and all that but when it came to salary they offered 85k. No bonus. I asked if there was room to negotiate, they said yes, then I asked if they can meet me in the middle between 92 to 100k. He told me he’ll speak to others in the company and will let me know and after that he’ll send me some other links for me to fill out. They didn’t reach out to me today, and I’m beginning to worry. I haven’t contacted them yet though. I feel what I asked was reasonable and I was very polite all the time. What do you think? If they do reach back out but said that’s their final offer, as much as I’d want more money I will accept the original offer but how can I say it without losing face and keep some dignity? Should I reach out again, asking the HR guy some other questions related to work and see what happens? For full context, I live in Massachusetts so I still think asking for a little bit of money was reasonable because they want people with experience and I nailed all tech questions and passed their code test but I’m beginning to grow nervous they would ghost me. I mean, I have to take it because my mom had a surgery (they removed her uterus just this month after losing too much blood) and me and my sister are the ones taking care of her. Please let me know. Thanks"	2022-11-01T22:46:42Z	Neutral

The breadth and depth of this tutorial is totally beyond my expectation!! And thank you so much for taking the time to go through the various ways of doing things and making the challenges (exercise projects) realistic and interesting. I particularly like how you show us how we can keep improving the RPS, haha! Oh, how can I forget to mention all those little touches such as the hot keys and the emoji, haha, love them! I must say, your tutorial is the BEST 'Python for Beginners' that I've come across on YouTube and I am so happy that I found it! 

If I may, just a feedback on the last 2 tutorials, especially Lesson 23, it would be good to slow down a bit and highlight where the new files should be created from. I spent 3+ hours tearing my hair out trying to figure out why my codes wouldn't run, LOL!! The error messages were of no use at all. Eventually I figured out that I created the files in the wrong location! My .env file was inside the .venv folder whilst the weather.py was outside.  Wait for it... my .gitignore was also inside .venv!!!!  Can you imagine my horror when I ran 'git add .'? LOL!!!


Another problem I had was in setting up the .venv. I kept hitting a dead end. After a lot of researching, it turns out I need to Set-ExecutionPolicy. Also, ""source .venv\Scripts\Activate"" doesn't work for me but "".\.venv\Scripts\Activate"" does.

954	2023-10-24T17:59:22Z	@williamdixon3611	qwAFL1597eM	Good morning, Dave, I am enjoying your course but, I think it's more than just a beginner's course. Far more in depth than a true novice wanted to learn Python, or any other programming course could digest and understand in its entirety.   I have watched many courses on YouTube for learning programming and they are all the same basic structure. Instructors type a lot of code and without the student having the ability to practice what is being taught. I think giving the student the ability to learn what has been taught though given prescribed questions by the instructor after each section would be a major game changer for learning. I know students could pause the course and try it on their own but, most students do not have the ability to understand computer logic and structure. Is it possible for making a course with that in mind? Just a thought, Thanks for your time.	2023-10-24T17:59:22Z	Positive

You can truly see and feel your passion and being a novice (first intro to Django) the 2.5 hours of video literally took me a good 30 hours or so over the course of 3 days to complete. You can clearly see how much of an expert you are just by the speed of your approach and presentation but which caused me pain in trying to ""pause the video"" at the right moment to catch up and before you supersonic clicking away from the code and not revisiting. Frequently I was not able to keep up and I had to go through quite a bit of research elsewhere to find out what the remaining code or why my scrips weren't working LOL 

All in all it was BRILLIANT! My project works as presented and I now understand the Django structure and methodology and I think you've definitely set the platform for further practice and advancement for me. I will follow your other related work  for sure!"	2024-03-20T22:38:39Z	Positive

Then you fix the incorrect price value and submit again but this time (as described before) there's no image selected because the form 'forgot' the one you entered before.

This shows a design flaw with the page - it should display an error if no image has been selected, or it should account for the user not selecting an image (maybe by displaying a default image if the item does not have an image)."	2023-09-06T10:35:42Z	Neutral

DISCLAIMER: You should know the basics of DJANGO first, don't go in with zero knowledge. The instructor says at 2:09 that You just need to know HTML and Tailwind, but it is not true.

I have several years of Python knowledge, didn't know anything about Django and thought that this will be my first intro to DJANGO. Wrong! I am now considering to learn the basics through documentation and chatting with ChatGPT and coming back to this course to make a speed run with it again in the future.

""git push -u origin branch_name""
The branch_name here is the current local branch or the remote branch?

1330	2024-02-05T13:53:44Z	@Tachiguro	RGOj5yH7evk	"I like the slow tutorial, so you can follow it. But sadly there are a lot of wrong expaination. It is a good practice to understand the topic, if you are explaining it.
Some examples: 
1. ""la"" is not a command on a mac it is just an alias probably added with ""Oh my zsh!"", you can create your own aliases in in UNIX like Os very easy, type ""alias --help"" to get more information about it.
2. ""Because it's blue it means it's a folder"" This is in hers situation right because she uses ""Oh my zsh!"" with this kind of theme there are a lot of different themes for ""Oh my zsh!"" by the way you can also beautify your bash with ""Oh my bash!"" but for everyone else: if you use ""ls -l"" you will get the content of a folder and if the first sighn in the line is a ""d"" so it is a directory, you can learn more about ls just type: ""man ls""
3. ssh key: you email don't need to be the same you just need the key... you can learn more about ssh-keygen just type: ""man ssh-keygen""
By the way you should learn as first to use the man pages type ""man man"" to learn more. man pages are documentation about programs or functions. Not every program has a page in man pages but a lot of them. you can even search in terminal for a program|command just type ""apropos <what you searching for>""
Probably I should make a tutorial..."	2024-02-05T13:53:44Z	Positive

For one thing, GitHub has changed a bit since this video was made.  But the real show stopper is that you are 90% devoted to Mac and I'm using Windows.  It's hard enough for some people to learn new things, let alone, trying to convert commands to different operation systems.	2023-11-18T01:39:36Z	Neutral

Quick question at 55:37 you merged with master while staying on quick-test(sub-branch), it didn't bring any changes to the master branch. So what I meant to ask is if I to bring changes into my master branch I should do the opposite right!?

1. This video was created 3yrs ago, the GitHub was not yet advanced compared to how it is now. Yes I have Github account thanks to this video

2. Visual Studio Code is also advanced because there's an option that allows you to clone without going to the terminal. You simply copy the address of the repository you want to clone in Github and past it on the address box on VSCode.

Which makes the video to be outdated given the fact that VSC and Github have advanced since this video was shot. I struggled until I saw the differences between Github 2023 Sep 16 and the one used in the video(3yrs ago). Same applies for VSC, it is so advanced thanks to the developers of Microsoft

1678	2023-03-20T21:23:35Z	@mannistudio	RGOj5yH7evk	"Luv'd this course.  BUT, I got myself in a bit of a jam.  I was in a directory that has several sub-dirs which also contain files.  I believe I accidentally typed in:  git add . (dot) which then added every subdir + files into git as untracked.  Not good as I now have many, many dirs & files in untracked status.  I did not do a commit (thank gawd).  So, i tried all kinds of combos of:  git clean;  git clean -fd & git rm --cached on just a few files or on a subdir/files (backed up of course) and found that these commands actually delete the file on disk along with untracked files in the work area.  This is really bad.  So how do I back out of this predicament? Here is an example.  Each dir ha many files:

$ git status -s
?? ./
?? ../Javascript/
?? ../SquareAPI/
?? ../Project X/
?? ../Project Y/"	2023-03-20T21:34:12Z	Neutral

You explain EVERYTHING clearly and concisely.  If I now take the time to take some notes and make an outline of the steps, for reference until they become second nature, I will be on my way to successfully using git on a frequent basis for various tasks.  My  goal is to be able to setup a git repository with all of the bash aliases and scripts that I want in a repo so that when I setup new devices I can clone all that without futzing around with usb sticks and such.

git add vs git commit
----------------------------------
- ""git add"" sends a modified file in your working repository to the staging area; files are NOT committed
- ""git commit"" saves files from the staging area; takes a snapshot of your repository's current state, and creates a new revision with a log. each version has a unique identifier.

commit vs push
--------------------------
- commit only saves files locally 
- push sends committed (saved) files to a [specified] remote repository

working directory --> staging area --> local repository --> remote repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
working directory files are sent to the staging area via ""git add"". 
staging area files are added and saved to your local repository via ""git commit"".
local repository files are added to a remote repository via ""git push"".

the rabbit hole is deep. Happy new years!

Amazingly explained all important and, I believe, the most commonly used git commands / Github operations in such an easy to understand manner.

2175	2022-06-19T06:18:08Z	@vennkan	RGOj5yH7evk	Great Video. Some updates and confusions I cleared as I worked through this in June 2022.  1. I didnt quiet clearly get the actual key name should be left blank inorder to create it in its default name. ~/.ssh/id_rsa. 21:40. Now if I go back and search ls  ~/.ssh ,I can see id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. 2. Also if you are using Mac, you may not see ~/.ssh/config under ~/.ssh and thats ok. Go ahead and create it and add the three line as shown in 24:38. I just didnt catch these two points while creating the SSH keys. Only after all this, you can start Git clone 15:02.	2022-06-19T06:18:38Z	Neutral

Hopefully I can teach my friends in time. I've just become your newest subscriber, so many thanks and please keep up the excellent teaching.

My github account was created pre-2020 so I believe I'm having issues with branches. Basically; when I created the demo-repo2 local directory everything was working fine until I got to the 'git push -u origin main' step. I was getting an error basically saying main was undefined or something along those lines. I tried using 'git push -u origin master' and it successfully pushed it according to CLI. If I check git status it shows no changes available.

HOWEVER - When I go to that repository on github it still shows as an empty repository; the changes are not appearing to push there. I ran 'git branch' from the demo-repo2 folder on my local vscode client and it shows 'master' as the branch. When I do the same from the 'demo-repo' dir I created earlier in the video it shows 'main' as the branch... so I've managed to end up with a main and master branch, and I don't know how to correct this issue. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"	2022-03-06T22:26:28Z	Neutral

Thanks for a great intro.
Two questions in relation to collaboration via Forking:
- When you fork I understand it as you are detached from updates to the main project.
Q1 - You mention deleting a branch when your PR has been accepted. Should you not delete the entire local forked Repo and Fork again for the next update - so when doing the next update you are sure to have the latest version of Master/Dev?
Q2 - Is there a way ""smarter way"" to update a fork to contain the most recent branch from the original repo, perhaps even an automatic setting such that your remote master/dev branches are always up to date ?

Thanks again

Edit: Upon reviewing the tutorial again, I'd like to say:

1. When creating a tutorial, you guys should _truly_ understand the importance of slowing down to the pace of the learner. In the beginning you walk us through a nice set of key terms (which was exceptional), then start mixing lots of advanced and beginner-level concepts together in your explanations, confusing the person that's watching the video. Slow down, explain like we're 5, that's why we're here.

2. To expand upon the issue of mixing things up I mentioned above, it's okay to keep a tutorial short, and add footnotes later if you think that the advanced concepts you're touching on are still worth being aware of. That way, the beginner can truly focus their attention on the basics, and then access the footnote only when they feel comfortable with the knowledge they've acquired thus far, making the content of your footnotes even more effective. After all, isn't good programming about being efficient? 

I used to get annoyed at being expected to take additional English classes as a Computer Science student, but now I understand why. I spent 4 hours yesterday debugging a Terminal issue, only to later realize that there was an ""issue"" because the person who created the how-to GitHub document instructed the reader to paste this code into the Terminal command line: 

*eval ""$(ssh-agent exec -s)""*

They said to *paste* this command in the terminal (meaning: include the quotation marks). After 4 hours of learning about chmod, File Links, Groups, root directory, Inodes—things I knew NOTHING about prior to this, I resolved my problem by simply removing the quotation marks. 

Now, the arrogant developer might say, ""Well that's obvious"". No it's not! The person said ""paste"", meaning I would: 

- Select the piece of code
- Apply ctrl+c to it, for Windows (cmd+c on Mac)
- Go to the Terminal and apply ctrl+v/cmd+v

Either the tutorial should have been made like this: 

*eval $(ssh-agent exec -s)* ,  

or the person writing the document should I mentioned that the quotation marks need to be removed. 

As Software Engineering becomes more collaborative, programmers can no longer get away with being asocial, and communication impaired, so this is an area a lot more engineers need to start being proficient in ."	2021-11-08T15:21:02Z	Neutral

If I need to get the last state and know if there are Conflicts with my changes, then a pull later will not make a big sense.. as we are going to push twice instead of once.	2021-09-22T10:17:10Z	Neutral

""git is not recognized as an internal or external command""

So I followed instruction from stackoverflow - to correctly set PATH in Windows 10 to point at Git installation:

1. Go to My Computer => Local Disk(C:) => Program Files => Git => cmd
2. Right Click the git => Select Properties and copy cmd path location
3. Come back and in the Start Menu or taskbar search, search for ""environment variable"".
4. Select ""Edit the system environment variables"".
5. Click the ""Environment Variables"" button at the bottom.
6. Double-click the ""Path"" entry under ""System variables"".
7. With the ""New"" button in the PATH editor, add previously copied CMD path to the end of the list.
8. Press OK
9. Close and re-open your command prompt.


Easy way to avoid messing with PATH variables in the first place is to re-install Git 
and select ""Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"" 
(NOT ""Use Git from Git Bash only"")"	2021-07-22T09:28:51Z	Neutral

It is extremely difficult to determine the mathmatical relationship, as that seed is destroyed during key creation; however, if you have both keys it is simple to solve.  The simplest explanation that everyone can understand is ""You can only read messages encrypted with one key using the other key.  Because everyone has access to the public key, everyone can read messages encrypted with the private key.  Conversely, a message encrypted using the public key can only be read by someone who has the private key.  That's why it is critical to keep private keys secure."""	2021-06-18T14:16:54Z	Neutral

3153	2021-01-31T07:41:23Z	@rodolfovitangcol450	RGOj5yH7evk	"Business Opportunity in Ruvol

I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  

It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” 

The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.

HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?

I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0

BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!

It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   

Thanks and God bless!

It looks like one must now specify (explicitly) on which branch it's located (in this case ""main""). So, now, the total steps to follow, for this particular case, would be:

git remote add origin git@github.com:Username/Repository_Name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Otherwise (at least in my case) an error appears. With that extra line of code it works fine."	2021-03-28T16:00:26Z	Neutral

My new project always starts with new github repo and git bash. I feel now like a pro... :D Hahah. I doing testing to create conflict between feature branches and main and learn to  fix it so i can understand how that works. Its awesome fun. Even more, VScode has integrated version control and understand what i am doing to my git, so i can visually look at any time where i am in my branches and switch between them in just one click, publish, pull, reset etc without typing in terminal, but its way more cool to type that yourself so you can feel the power. :D	2021-01-11T01:12:01Z	Positive

However, command prompt or git bash will allow you to show hidden folders. One way that I did this is by changing the default terminal in VS Code to command prompt. In terminal view, click on the drop down menu and click on ""Select Default shell"" then choose ""Command Prompt"" or ""Git Bash"".

You can add the following code to your settings.json file: ""terminal.integrated.shell.windows"": ""cmd.exe"". This will make the default terminal command prompt.

GitHub is also registering the new name as an email address because there's an @ symbol in the name it gave me, which is causing problems.

QUESTION FOR ALL: I am new to the Github system and just curious that if you voluntarily work on the project in Github, do you upload them into a local machine and work on specific consoles or code text editors like visual studio code?

I knew absolutely nothing about computers. Didn't even know anyone who had one. The computer came with a thick three-ring binder with the title, DOS. I read and reread and reread the entire book until it started to make sense. (The first version of Windows didn't come out until 1985.) In 1985, I bought an early copy of Symantec's Q&A, a (non-Windows) word processor, flat file, and report generator, which relied heavily on keystroke combinations to get things done but was hinting at a graphical interface. I ran a non-profit for many years with Q&A and loved it, such an improvement from WordStar. So, now at 72-years-old, to see CD = Change Directory, I say to myself, ""Hey, I can do this.""

1. How to create a repo locally through the CLI(Command Line Interface) or directly from GITHUB
2. git flow by using the most common commands: git add - git commit and git push/git pull, all of them with their corresponding explanation. What ""origin"", ""remote"" and ""master"" mean.
3. git branching: all the commands involve in that kind of operation as well as best practices.
4. git merging: when we use a ""feature"" branch and it's time to merge to the ""master"" branch  -- PR (Pull Request) on the Github side
5. How to deal with ""conflicts"" when merging.
6. Undoing in git: undoing from the stage area versus undoing if we have committed once or several times.
7. Understanding how and why we fork a repo on github.

I don't know if anyone has done it already but it would be much more clear if there was a second person as well to help out in the topics such as merging and pull requests and forking(where there is more than one person is involved...like Vuejs would be the organisation which would be looking a the pull request).So instead of just one person explaining things from her/his individual perspective there would be a second person who will review the pull requests made on her/his repo and merge them and comment as well."	2020-08-01T21:20:09Z	Positive

I have browsed Youtube for days watching tutorials for beginners but it turned out none of them were for people who have no coding experience whatsoever. What they end up doing is that I've become more confused on git rather than more familiar. This video includes a step-by-step guide and is easy to follow. The presenter is careful not to assume that the audience already know the basics, which is immensely helpful.	2020-07-23T03:31:47Z	Neutral

I have converted a simple excel spread sheet calculator to node.js package through a software called Spreadsheetconverter. I am using this software as trial. I can share with you the excel original calculator and the node.js folder. Again this is a learning through an example for me. 
let me know please.

It’s true, that Git does make messing thing up difficult, but not impossible.

Especially if you are a Junior Dev and haven’t taken a course like this one.

I am still junior, but I can say that if a team using Git properly, will get many benefits, but....         if the team lacks proper knowledge, then they will have lots of headaches dealing with merge conflicts.

00:00 *🎓 Craig Dennis offers an updated, beginner-friendly API course taught by an experienced developer educator.*
00:29 *💻 The course assumes basic coding knowledge and familiarity with web concepts but starts from the ground up, covering what APIs are, why they exist, and their benefits.*
03:22 *🔍 The course begins by breaking down the term ""API"" and its significance, then delves into hands-on experience with web APIs.*
04:17 *📱 Learners will build a web application utilizing existing APIs, focusing solely on using APIs rather than creating them.*
08:42 *🌐 APIs serve as contracts, defining usage expectations and facilitating communication between software components, locally and remotely.*
20:37 *📄 HTTP requests and responses contain crucial information like headers, status codes, and content type, facilitating effective communication between clients and servers.*
23:03 *🌐 Understanding basic concepts like HTTP and statelessness is crucial for comprehending RESTful APIs, which build upon these principles to expose and manipulate resources.*
24:59 *🔄 REST APIs follow client-server architecture and are stateless, requiring clients to maintain session details and send them with each request, adhering to REST constraints.*

it's in ruby language, 
chr(ord('y') ^ 0x20):

1. ord('y') : The `ord` method in Ruby returns the ASCII code of the character passed to it. In this case, `ord('y')` returns the ASCII code for the character 'y', which is 121.

2. 0x20 : This represents the hexadecimal value 20, which is equivalent to 32 in decimal.

3. `^` (XOR operator): The XOR (exclusive OR) operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of two numbers.

4. ord('y') ^ 0x20 This bitwise XOR operation is performed between the ASCII code of 'y' (121 in decimal) and 32. The result is 89.

5. chr(89):  The `chr` method in Ruby converts an ASCII code to its corresponding character. In this case, `chr(89)` returns the character with the ASCII code 89, which is 'Y'.

So, the overall expression `chr(ord('y') ^ 0x20)` takes the character 'y', performs a bitwise XOR with 32, resulting in the ASCII code 89, and then converts that ASCII code back to the character 'Y'."	2023-12-27T15:54:28Z	Neutral

There is no longer a console that you can access from your browser, you have to install multiple ""packages"" locally on your machine.

Spotify have made a tutorial (spread over a dizzying number of hyperlinked pages) to build an app. So in order to do the first tutorial for this video which requires the console, I went through some of the process (not knowing what I was installing or what I was doing) to try and get a command line environment that accesses Spotify's API, and eventually gave up. It didn't seem like that process was going to get me to a point where I could do the exercise in the video! :( 

Maybe Spotify view having their own tutorial as an even more accessible developer environment, but it made following this video impossible for me."	2023-11-28T20:16:02Z	Neutral

Recently I got my visa approved for Canada and I m looking to move there. I heard they have more requirement for this skillset in combination with mainframe. Could you please elaborate how mainframe use restapi as a front end. I think I heard you saying api is always backend so what is my company implying by using backend data with involvement of z/os connect and postman. We use 3270 mainframe systems and 3270 online (front end system). I heard they implemented  a system fix by using Cics cobol program by sending some data to Cics and that data I guess was pulled by z/os somehow and it was getting rendered on a website in form of something. Looked like someone created a restapi services using postman and this new api was accessing data from what was printed on a Cics job running in queue online during the day when the developer test his changes which is sort of making sense now.can you help me understand if I m understanding it right ?	2023-08-26T20:24:18Z	Positive

I'm stuck at this part as Spotify changed how to get access to authorization token. You have to run a curl command but when I copy and paste in into my terminal, changing the necessary parameters as needed (Client ID and Client Secret) it doesn't work (I'm on Windows btw. I made sure that curl is installed. It is)
What am I doing wrong?

Edit: Nevermind I got it to work. Its a bit annoying that the text editor I'm using (Notepad++) to post the copied code into first to be able to make changes to the parameters, doesn't allow me to copy and paste the code from the text editor to the terminal. I have to get rid of any newline characters. If anyone more experienced then me can give me some good text editors to work  in, please let me know :)"	2023-08-06T18:50:30Z	Neutral

They were manually configuring hundreds of appliance-type devices through their web UI's which took hours of work. One small change request was many more hours of work again. I realized that these appliances had an API and we were able to reduce hours of work into minutes by writing scripts that took a list of IP's and sent API commands to each device in the list. I did the same thing on another project and cut my estimated completion time in half. 

As someone who is in IT but is not a developer, even I could see the enormous power and potential of the API. It opens the door to automation, which reduces human error dramatically. It also speeds up onboarding. I am looking forward to watching this course and learning more about API's and their other uses."	2023-03-17T16:31:23Z	Neutral

I noticed that when he does the first search at 54:46, even though it brings up the wrong artist page, the Beyoncé song is there already at the bottom of the page - I guess because that’s the last song played on his Spotify profile. So that when he then puts in the correct url at 55:40, it brings up Beyoncé’s main page, but the same song is still there. Did anyone else have this happen to them and did you manage to show the correct track that was searched for? The url itself seems to only refer to the artist, but not the search for the track.

Not sure what I did wrong or how it keeps connecting Rihanna from Beyonce. I don't normally listen to either so it's certainly not some stray data throwing it off.	2023-02-12T18:37:43Z	Neutral

I don't know why you're using Twilio as everything... you said Postman is complicated, Twilio is on a next level of 'complicated'...
Why not use Visual Studio Code and start from scratch using only this editor and show us how to start and finish A WORKING PROJECT. You're trying to teach about an API. So start a project in VSC, take a dad jokes API as an example and teach us how everything works. The main objective to use an API is for a website to be interactive and right now I don't even know how to implement an API on a website so I can extract a user's custom query and show that data on a website as a result...

I think the reason is because when PostOut inherited from PostBase it expected the object to look like this:

{
        title: ""first post"",
        content: ""my first post"",
        published: True,
        Post: { title: ""first post again!?"", content: ""I posted my first post...for a second time??"", published: True, ... }
} 

It looks like the response model expected the title, content and publish to be in both the top level of the object and the nested Post object. However, the top level of the object did not return title, content, or publish and that is why we got the error that title, content, or publish were missing from our response object."	2023-07-24T10:38:59Z	Neutral

Strong video to build a foundation in api development with fastapi using python, and advanced technologies like CI/CD pipelines were taught in a wonderful way.

Follow these steps it has worked for me
1) Put the command docker ps and find your container ID
2) Then enter into the bash -> docker exec -t YOUR_CONTAINER_ID bash
3) Now it will enter into the bash, type -> alembic upgrade head
This will fix the issue by creating the tables to perform the action. Now go to Postman API and run the create user request, it will work. But the only issue is the data is not storing."	2023-06-24T13:41:56Z	Neutral

After doing so, you'll still get an error because it's not in the path. You might be inclined to source your shell .rc file. Just note that this will likely wipe out the path to the virtual installation of python. It will be wrong despite the terminal still showing (verv) or whatever. Select Interpreter again, open a new terminal, check pip version, and after install, make sure everything got installed correctly in verv/lib.	2023-05-11T23:57:37Z	Neutral

TypeError('cannot convert dictionary update sequence element #0 to a sequence')
try to add this line of code before returning results:
results = list ( map (lambda x : x._mapping, results) )
When querying the db with two arguments in the .query method, sqlalchemy returns a list of sqlalchemy.engine.row.Row objects. As far as I have acknowledged from the documentation:
""Changed in version 1.4:
Renamed RowProxy to .Row. .Row is no longer a ""proxy"" object in that it contains the final form of data within it, and now acts mostly like a named tuple. Mapping-like functionality is moved to the .Row._mapping attribute, but will remain available in SQLAlchemy 1.x ... ""
So, in my understanding, we are not allowed to retrieve the jsonized data directly from the query anymore; the ._mapping method takes care of building the dict structure with ""Post"" and ""votes"" keys, and using map does this for each .Row element in the list; we then convert map to a list to be able to return it. 
Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, or if you have any better workaround."	2023-04-12T16:53:03Z	Positive

The code at the 10:25:00 hr marker where you get count is incompatible with the new version of SQLAlchemy.
I spent a few hours figuring out why my exact same code isn't working.
Use the following command to install (or re-install) to a compatible version of SQLAlchemy
pip install --force-reinstall -v ""SQLAlchemy==1.4.46""

This here is an indication that there was a contradiction with a dependency call python-dateutil.
with  python-dateutil==2.8.2 the app would not build.
 python-dateutil==1.5 the app would build. but gives me that error up there where i was able to change it - that is updating the new version of 2.8.2 inside the local tz.py file -locally and it worked there .
However, Heroku only work with version 1.5, my app requires 2.8.2.
I tried the pipenv way where I would set my environment to work with 2.8.2 but heroku still yelled at me for not having the correct version 1.5.

only thing I am trying to find now, is a way to update that dependency "" /site-packages/dateutil/tz.py  "" in the env that Heroku creates when it is building my app. I went to thier github and found the newer version where they updated this tz.py. I suspect this could be one way to make it work. I just have to find a way to update it inside heroku

The cursor.execute() method takes an iterable object as its 2nd argument(like list, tuple, string, etc.), because internally the function loops through the values passed in 2nd argument, to place them into the ""%s"" placeholders of the 1st argument. Now, when we write like this :- (id) or like (2), because of only single value, it is considered as integer, and not a tuple even parenthesis are used. 
But if we just put a comma and make it like this:- (id,) or (2,), it is indicative of multiple values, and now the object is a tuple, which is an iterable.

Here, we actually do not need the string conversion that is being shown here as cursor.execute(...,str(id)), and we can simply do it as cursor.execute(... , (id,)). It is better actually.

4999	2022-06-07T06:34:12Z	@raianmr2843	0sOvCWFmrtA	"I did some digging in the psycopg2 implementation and I think I have an explanation that ties together what you're addressing at 4:21:33 and 4:23:36. 

TLDR: Always use a 'sequence' like tuples, lists, and so on for the second parameter of cursor.execute(). For tuples with a single object, write '(object, )' instead of '(object)'. 

Firstly, we should look at some signatures.

The execute method for cursor objects:
def execute(self, query: str | bytes | Composable, vars: _Vars = ...) -> None: ...

The _Vars type alias:
_Vars: TypeAlias = Sequence[Any] | Mapping[str, Any] | None

These explain what makes the 'convert to str' workaround tick. But as you've demonstrated before while writing the create_posts function, you can pass non-string values (e.g., bools in the case of post.published) just fine. So, why wasn't '(id)' working? I think this is because of the weird syntax of Python's tuples. '(id)' is not necessarily a tuple, and therefore not a sequence either. But '(id, )' is always a tuple in Python, and so it works just fine. But when you're forcing it to be a tuple with that extra comma, your previous workaround of converting to string becomes redundant. And because that workaround doesn't always work, I think it's safe to say that we should try not to write code that way. I hope this helped."	2022-06-07T06:34:12Z	Neutral

Simply put, the connection.execute('SQL', (VARIABLES,)) function expects you to pass in the variables in a tuple. In python, you cannot declare a tuple of length one unless you specify it. Two ways to specify that, first is to cast it to the tuple() function, and the other option is to pass in the first item of the tuple and put a single comma (item1,) to indicate a tupple. So, what happens is, when you pass a single item to the tuple and no comma, the () are stripped away and the type of the item gets passed directly.	2022-05-15T20:22:21Z	Neutral

Very thorough, at a good pace for beginner or intermediate level, and comprehensive. From references to relevant resources, to deep dives into the how and why of processes and implementation, I really got a lot out of this. So much so that I did the walkthrough once as it, and now I'm using it as reference and guide a second time (at 1.25 speed) for reiteration/repetition and in order to develop a new portfolio project based around a Music Library implementation. 5 out of 5 stars, would recommend.	2022-02-02T04:48:22Z	Positive

To do all the alembic stuff with Sanjeev, I had to stop my uvicorn server and import in the following way:
models.py : from app.database import Base # alembic ok but server error
database.py: from app.config import settings # alembic ok but server error
config.py:  env_file = "".env"" # alembic ok but server error

If I leave those lines as above and try to start my uvicorn server, I get a pile of errors to do with imports. 
So, to run the server (when going through the CORS material), I have to change the above lines to:
models.py :  from database import Base # alembic error but server runs
database.py:  from config import settings # alembic gave error but server runs
config.py: env_file = ""../.env"" # for server ok but alembic error

Searching around I can find some reference to this type of error. I **think** it might have to do with the line
prepend_sys_path = . in the alembic.ini file that is run when doing alembic init
https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/797

1. Moved the verify_token code block inside get_current_user.
2. Retrieved also the ""expire"" value from decoded token. If value is none, raise exception. If available then compare it with current time. If current time is greater than the expiry time then it means token is expired , so raise exception. Code block here:

expire = payload.get(""expire"")
    if expire is None:
        raise credentials_exception
       
    if datetime.now() > datetime.fromtimestamp(expire) :
        raise credentials_exception


Note: I used ""datetime.fromtimestamp(expires)"" instead of expires directly because earlier in create_access_token, the ""expire"" value was converted to expire.timestamp() before it was appended/updated to the ""to_encode"" variable.

The cur.execute() method takes two arguments - 1. A string, which is a SQL query . 2. A tuple, which contains the variables we want to pass into that query. So, in Python we define a tuple with a single element as --> ( id , )  not ( id ) . Here ( id ) is just an integer not a tuple .

The issue seems to lie in inheriting from PostBase (or Post for that matter) from schemas. The issue is fixed when PostOut inherits from BaseModel instead. 
As the response (without response model) returns a Post dictionary and a vote count, it does not have the fields that PostBase requires (title and content are present in the Post dictionary within the response, not within the response directly like vote count). PostBase (or Post) can be used if a new dictionary is defined that includes all the fields that PostBase (or Post) requires.
Also orm_mode need not be set in PostOut as it uses the class Post that has orm_mode set (this is used to import owner information and show it as a dictionary despite it being an object).
Also the fields defined in PostOut must match what the query returns (which can be seen by removing the response model), which is why the field 'Post' must have a capital P (as the model.py contains Post) and why the label for vote count in the query must be the same as the respective field defined in PostOut."	2021-12-16T06:11:56Z	Neutral

Because PostOut(PostBase) is inheriting from ""PostBase"" is still expecting to find the ""title"", ""content"" etc. fields, which you aren't providing, you have just extended it adding an additional field ""Post"". When we come back at 10:25.43, you have changed it to inherit ""BaseModel"" which isn't expecting those fields and so works fine - nothing to do with the capitalisation."	2021-11-25T13:55:47Z	Positive

It's as simple as creating an enum

eg:

from enum import Enum

class VoteType(int, Enum):
     UP = 1
     DOWN = 0

class Vote(BaseModel):
     post_id: int

A quirk of python is that (id) is not a tuple. To create a tuple you have to do (id,) else it sees it as an int.  Interesting thing is, because it expects an iterable you can use a list  like this (""""""SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=%s"""""", [id]).fetchone()."	2021-11-06T07:51:59Z	Neutral

5523	2021-11-06T02:23:43Z	@rainwave5	0sOvCWFmrtA	"04:23:45 for anyone curious whenever you pass in arguments into a cursor for a db as such you always wants to turn the information into a tuple. So as Sanjeev mentioned you can just use 
(value,) # this is assuming its a single value
or 
(value1, value2) or (value1, value2,)
09:38:15 So I believe here you could just place bool as the type validation because then if then send 0 it should transform to false or if they do 1 then it should transform to true and vice-versa. So whichever value you wanted can be taken from it.
10:26:10 This error is kind of interesting and I got it as well. I think the best way to go about troubleshooting is to understand that pydantic is going to an error when it isn't provided with sufficient  data as opposed to being provided with too much. After all the response model is meant to cut down the data that is shown to the client. So with this in mind for my schema I made it inherit it from the base model (our imported class) rather than from one of created schema. I think stacking too many schemas put's double the requirements specifically  for the title and content field. One good method to debug this is by inserting in default values into the fields that are causing validation errors as this will create a trail leading you to the issue.
~ 10:15:26 - 10:28:21  more or less here when you group on a column and return columns that are not in the group by nor  being aggregated by a function such as SUM() then you will get an error from SQL. Although I'm not sure why Postgresql didn't return an error. While I was using MS-SQL Server I just did a windowing analytic function such as ...
func.count(models.<insert your orm model>.<insert your column>).over(partition_by=models.<insert your orm model>.<insert your column(group by column)>)).label(""<quoi qu'il soit>"")

https://vitux.com/how-to-edit-config-files-in-ubuntu/
a good website if you had some issues using vi in ubuntu

12:59:16  if you have problems with your virtual environment where gunicorn isnt in the bin directory then you can use this instead  after installing the library python3 -m venv.

~13:50:00 Around here more or less is where I was having issues connecting to postgres in the container . So What I did was just follow a similar process to what we did for the Ubuntu droplet on digital ocean. So i went into pg_hba and changed some of those settings to md5 and then to be safe in postgres.conf I enabled ""*"" for the local connections.
Also I had to start the container with the image and then run alembic. Then do docker-compose down and then start it up again.

14:05:00 Here I hadn't been able to log in from the command line nor push any image from docker desktop. So it turns out you can just slightly modify a file in /.docker/config.json just change credsStore to credStore. I'm also using WSL2.

I was thinking about this years ago. Good work!

I also think that watched video shouldn't be a separate object because it doesn't make sense to create a new object every time a user watches a video. Instead, I think there should be a database table for watched videos with userID, seekTime, and videoID that can be queried in the VideoConsumingService."	2023-05-07T20:18:01Z	Neutral

1. when commenting on a video.. why is the author's name sent in the POST, if the system already has it? (by processing the token on the header of the POST request)

2. why does the user (after closing the window) ask for the timestamp, and then make another request with that value? the way i see it the server already has that data too.. it could directly return the videoframe on the 1st request

3. and the last one... how is it possible that when commenting, the ID of the comment is sent in the POST? 
thats the most weird of all.. it is not even saved in the database yet. it doesn't have an ID. or even worse.. would't this lead to duplicate IDs if 2 users comment at the same time?

am i sharper than normal today, or am i missing something?

It is more about:
- Is it cheap? is it scaleable? at this stage of the project can I utilize my available resource? 
- Do we need schemaless/no schemaless, usually because of shameless, the database needs to take more space for storing and is slower at execution. Like dynamic-typed langue vs typed language. 
- Can I make relationship ?  (typically the NoSQL is considered weak relationship, BUT YOU CAN STILL MAKE RELATIONSHIP. PLUS, BECAUSE OF SCHEMALESS YOU CAN  EMBED DOCUMENT FOR MAKING THE RELATIONSHIP AND MAKING THE QUERY FASTER WITHOUT JOINING ACROSS TABLES )
- How about its built-in function? it is usually better if you make the computation on the database instead of pulling it down to the server and computing and of course, you don't have to re-develop that function

However, I have a question.
Now, I am following your tutorial and learning. But I noticed often you import a package from a file that you have not created yet but you will do in future, Like at @1.53.50, you imported access from auth_svc which you created after.
How do you do it? I mean did you create a workflow before so you already know which file/function would be necessary?

docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name test-mongo mongo:latest

Very important to have port tunneling since otherwise Gateway wont be able to connect to 27017 port. 
After that step I finally got ""success"" from upload request.

There is need for automation and validation while editing either python or k8s yaml files.

After downloading mongo on my local, it worked. Perhaps you would like to add that in at the start.

Some environmental variables like server.config[""MYSQL_PORT""] = int(os.environ.get(""MYSQL_PORT"")) needed to add an int infront.

I just wanted to clarify for everyone that the cause of the problem with the 'Internal server error' is that we establish the connection (and create the channel) as a top-level statement. Kubernetes is smart enough to ""find"" the new IP when the rabbitmq service is restarted (because it obtains the IP using a DNS lookup), however, since the connection is being established as a top-level statement (basically when the server is started) there is no way for the server to establish a new connection when it brokes (unless it is restarted). RabbitMQ has been built to be used with a single connection by each consumer, thus opening and closing the connection in every request would be even worse. A more reasonable solution would be to check if the connection is healthy (connection.is_open) before using the channel and establish a new connection when it breaks."	2023-09-29T21:32:44Z	Neutral

Also, I noticed you’re tagging your containers after the build by copying the build reference into the terminal.  One way of simplifying your workflow with containers is to add the tag command right to the build like so: “docker build . -t repo:tag1 -t repo:latest”. Your great educator and a lot of inspiration.

One request - while there are people advising to go, read and contribute to open source code for better experience (like reading Spring source code), I think it will be better if there is a tutorial created by someone who can walk through a real open source project and explaining it. That will greatly help many developers in my opinion. Please create a series of possible, thanks.	2022-12-07T19:17:58Z	Positive

1. What does ""not have any active Endpoint"" mean? From kubectl get services i see they all have CLUSTER-IP, is that the endpoint ingress controller is looking for or something else?

6415	2024-01-14T01:27:12Z	@mariuszzawierucha1310	5199E50O7SI	Sorry but I'd like somebody explain to me why I should consider using GraphQL? I really don't see a point.  I mean in case when I store a huge amount of data (it won't be in single file like here) then I need to use for example Postgress db. Then to receive data I have to write SQL queries to get them out. So why not use very specyfic sql query to get data I want and in the same time limit network traffic?From my point of view it looks like we are trying to add for car extra 5th weel for stability. It should be easier but from my perspective is oposite, and higher complexity doesn't give us more speed here. It's going to be slower.	2024-01-14T01:27:12Z	Neutral

Redis is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
Key features and concepts of Redis include:
Support for various data structures like strings, hashes, sets, lists, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperlog logs, and geospatial indexes.
Architecture with Redis client and server, supporting master-slave configurations for distributed systems.
Advantages such as speed, with the ability to store the entire dataset in primary memory, asynchronous data persistence, rich data types, and atomic operations.
02:19 🧰 Installing and Starting Redis

Methods to install Redis on different systems, including downloading from the official website, using Docker, or via package managers like apt for Ubuntu.
Commands to start the Redis server and verify its installation status.
04:08 🛠 Basic Operations with Strings in Redis

Demonstrating string commands like SET, GET, GETRANGE, MSET, MGET, STRLEN, RENAME, SETEX, INCR, DECR, INCRBY, DECRBY, SETFLOAT, and EXPIRE.
Explaining how to handle strings, integers, and floating-point values, along with commands for manipulation and expiration.
11:28 📜 Operations with Lists in Redis

Introduction to list data type and commands such as LPUSH, RPUSH, LRANGE, LLEN, LPOP, RPOP, LINSERT, LINDEX, SORT, BLPOP, BRPOP for list manipulation.
Demonstrating list operations including insertion, retrieval, removal, sorting, and blocking operations for queues.
22:09 🧩 Operations with Sets in Redis

Overview of set data type in Redis and commands like SADD, SMEMBERS, SISMEMBER, SCARD, SPOP, SRANDMEMBER, SREM for set manipulation.
Explanation of set operations for managing unique collections and performing set-based operations like union, intersection, difference, and membership checks.
22:26 🛠 Redis Sets Overview

Redis sets allow adding multiple members.
Commands like SADD, SMEMBERS, SCARD, and SISMEMBER are used to manipulate sets efficiently.
29:39 🎯 Redis Sorted Sets Introduction

Redis sorted sets add an extra value (score) to each element, allowing sorting.
Commands like ZADD, ZRANGE, ZCOUNT, and ZREVRANGE are used for sorted set operations.
36:56 🧮 Redis HyperLogLog Data Structure

HyperLogLog is used for probabilistic counting of unique values.
Commands like PFADD, PFCOUNT, and PFMERGE are utilized for HyperLogLog operations.
39:32 🔑 Redis Hashes Overview

Redis hashes store map-like data with string keys and string values.
Commands like HSET, HGET, HDEL, and HLEN are used to manipulate hash data efficiently.
44:10 🔍 Understanding Redis HSTRLEN Command

Explaining how to use the HSTRLEN command to find the length of a field in a hash set.

If i do 2000 times of cotinuous 'get' from redis, without any interver between the execution, it takes long time for the first 'get' (0.03 second), and the shorter time(0.001 second) for the following every 'get's. And when I do 2000 times of 'get' with 3 seconds of intervals, like all of the 'get' being the first attempt, it takes long time for every 'get's. what is the reason, and how to fix this?  i checked the maxmemory policy and it was 'noeviction'.

But i hope someone answers me about two point i can't understand seriously.
1 - about server : you said on explain company like google can creat so many servers to get more speed to be faster to response, right, all i want understand whene i share i data (image or video) he uploaded into all this servers or just one of them, i mean the more near to me? Beacuse : if it's the first answer and google uploaded the same data to all servers, that took more time and take more space. If it's not and data transfer only to one server, then the result be the same. Beacuse someon on chine for exemple and he want get responses that took time to travel btween different ips (local > régional > global).
2 : my second question about how wireless work, it's the same like cable or different way, but such firstly i know what's the access point ( if am not wrong i think its whene a router connect with cable and share a access point wireless in same distance) but i mean in this case, the wireless by satellite that Elon mask creat for example?
It's send directly from satellite to near tour to your device or took some structure to response?

That said, its still very important to watch this video, in my opinion as I have only a summary of its content. Anyways here you guys go - hope you will find these notes useful!



			      INTERNET

Switch
To connect different computers in an environment together we can use a switch. To connect all the computers to the switch we can use copper wires or fibre optic cables which are faster. Copper wires can be of two types those are CAT-5 and CAT-6. Category 6 is faster than category 5. The switch has ports on them called LAN ports, they are called LAN ports because switches are the ones that help us in creating a LAN.




Access points
Access points are similar to switches but they can be connected to wirelessly.

Once connected with these wires this network forms a LAN(local area network) coz it is located in a specific local area. To send data from PC 1 to PC 6 if they are in a network, the computer creates messages in packets and sends it to the switch. The switch then reads the contents of the packet and understands the destination of the package and sends it to the dest in this case PC6.



How do devices connect to the internet
To create a LAN a switch is fine. But how do devices connect to the internet. For this we use something called a router. The switch is connected to the router with the help of a copper wire. But to actually connect to the internet we use a wire provided by the ISP(internet service provider) for a given price. To send a packet to the internet, the computer first sends it to the switch then the switch sends it to the router and then the router acts like a door to the internet.
Each house or residence will have a LAN. The router helps us in connecting the computer to another computer in the world. In other words the router helps us connect two different LANS together.



What is the internet?
The internet helps connect all the LANs together and creates a network. A home router is very important, it is basically a mix of a router and a switch. This typically also has a access point feature so we can connect to it wirelessly.
So why cant there be just one router and all home routers connect to that router. Well first of all the main router will have to have millions of ports so that each device can connect to it. But the main problem is one router will have to carry all the load making it single point of failure. So in this case if there is a single problem with the router than the internet of the whole world will crash at the same time. Also long cables would be required.


These cables to connect to the internet are even laid down on the ocean floor! If one of these cables are broken it can cause the internet of that continent to break. These are all fibre optic cables coz the speed of data transmission is very high.

Say a computer from India has to send a packet to a computer in Mexico. First the router takes this packet and sends it through cables to another router. This router now has many options to pass this packet forward. To choose the best one it has something called a routing table. The routing table is developed through special algorithms which are created by the processor in the router. It them forwards this packet to the next router based on the routing table. This process of passing the packets is called forwarding. This process repeats until the packet reaches its destination.

One important thing to note is that the router always tries to take the shortest path to reach the dest. This may not be the shortest path visually but taking into account many factors like traffic etc. 
The internet is a network of networks.



Say youtube wants to transmit data to you after you send a request to it. The way it will do this is it will send packets of data to you through the internet. This sending of data piece by piece is called streaming. When we want this packet from youtube, we are actually communicating with high powered computers from youtube called servers. There are many youtube servers distributed around the world to avoid single point of failure.



WAN(Wide area network)
This is to connect two LANs together. You might be wondering then what is the difference between this and the internet. The main difference is privacy.
Assume one LAN network which is an office wants to send data to another Lan network, well if they do this through the internet then the data can be exploited because the internet is public. So if they are in a LAN then only those local computers can access it and if they are in a WAN then only the two connected LAN networks will be able to access the data as it is private.The most popular WAN network method is called VPN(virtual private network). VPN tunnelling provides a tunnel for data transmission in a public network but also gives you anonymity and is more secure. It encrypts your data packets before sending them. People generally use VPN’s to access restricted websites.



How does VPN tunnelling work?
Well the thing is since there really isn’t a physical tunnel connecting the two LAN routers, the data can still be accessed. But the data is put into a secure envelope per say just like you put a letter in an envelope, this data is then encrypted so data cant be hacked or accessed. Putting the data to be transmitted into an envelope or another packet is called encapsulation.



Since the internet is a public network, don’t you think that the data you send to networks like amazon can be hacked?
Well to some extent it can’t be hacked because of something called end to end encryption. In this system only the two communicating users will be able to see the data.



Which is the biggest WAN in the world?
The biggest WAN in the world is the internet itself. But there is a difference between the WAN connection between two offices and the internet. The internet is public and is owned by everyone in the world.


A LAN is more secure than WAN because LAN never passes over the internet but WAN even with VPN passes over the internet.




Public and Private WAN


In a private WAN you can buy a line directly from your ISP and use that private line for connection of networks. This is more secure but it can be very costly especially over long distances. That is why average companies generally prefer Public WANS

We use switches to create a LAN and routers to create a WAN. We cannot use a switch to create a WAN



What is the ISP?
The internet is made up of a connection of many different routers. The routers of the world are connected by these different ISP’s. Each ISP can control specific routers.	 ISP’s are the companies that allow us to connect to the internet. There are many different ISP’s in the world.



LOCAL ISP’S
Local isp’s are responsible for connection of LANS in a locality. These local isps then connect to the regional ISP. So we can say that different local ISPs connect together in a regional ISP. We can say that local isps connect localities like neighbourhoods and Regional ISP’s connect cities in a country. So a network of the country is formed by regional and local ISPs. Global ISPs connects different countries systems together.  

Note : some Local ISP’s can interact with global isps without regional ISPs
Local ISP’s are generally smaller companies and they sometimes may want a direct connection with a global ISP so that there customers can have a better experience

Say a computer in Belgium wants to connect to a website in India but that website has only one server. In this case the user sends a request and the packet moves through the local ISP and regional ISP and global ISP to reach the server of the website. This website then sends the response with all relevant information. The path taken by the request and response can be different as these paths are never fixed. A company like google is very different from this random company. It has servers all around the world, so that its customers can get faster speeds. But sometimes even google faces some slight problems with speed and can dissatisfy its customers. But, google has a good solution for this. This solution is peering.



In peering, googles servers establish a direct connection with our local ISP’s neglecting the need of an ISP infrastructure, This also increases the security.
So we can say that googles fast service speed is because of its distributed servers and peering infrastructure.

It is also possible for us to connect directly to a regional ISP for faster connection."	2021-08-04T15:05:43Z	Neutral

7363	2023-10-21T05:06:55Z	@DanyPellerin	9He4UBLyk8Y	"Ignorance is bliss.

Looking at this almost makes it sound easy to learn all these thing. Sure basic HTML and CSS is easy (some could even argue css can be challenging).

Getting into JS is a different story, learning the foundation, the patterns, the pitfalls, learning some framework is far more challenging than it seems and will take easily take years to master.

How to even debug properly, use the dev tools. Accessibility? Did we even mention that?

You also need to learn to collaborate and there's a lot of tooling around that, Figma, Miro, etc.

Then you need to learn the domain you're working in, the business logic. You also need to learn to write clean code and learn to work with other's people code. And how to refactor legacy code.

How to write code that is low coupling with high cohesion? Sounds easy, right? 

Then you need to learn some architecture, how to design a solution, how everything connects together, the different development environments, UAT, preprod, prod, QA. 

Ah right, how are we tracking the code and getting customer feedback? Oh and I forgot, what about the methodology, how to be truly agile.

I didn't even cover how testing can be challenging. How do you debug those tests, how to write meaningful tests. Oh and the metrics.

Then to prepare for interviewing you better know some data structure and algorithms, and be able to communicate your thought process clearly, under pressure.

Many other things I'm not even talking about and some I barely scratched the surface. Did I even mention security? 

Being a developer is a bumpy road and it's extremely challenging. Everything you learn now will be outdated in a couple year so better focus on the foundation. But still, there's just so much to know and it's always evolving.

Good luck with all that, hope you get good seniors to guide you gently and not some hardcore PMs with impossible deadlines!"	2023-10-21T05:06:55Z	Positive

Then I started this one. I'm 4 hours in with 7 hours to go, I have to say that things start to get a bit different. Some random css thrown in without saying why and I watch some of the same sections twice to see if I missed anything but no I didn't miss anything. This style specifically makes it really hard to continue to learn this way. Like units, sizes, flexbox, grid layout  def need a more in-depth touch if this is going to serve to the beginners without the need to switch to other resources like ChatGPT. 

For example: I'm asking ChatGPT why we use: 
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
in the same place. As there is no explanations for it in the course as a beginner expects one so I constantly stop the video and go on ChatGPT to clarify any confusion and so a complete beginner should not expect to learn the fundamentals of css here even if this is a 11-hour video cause as you continue ""but why"" questions will clutter your mind.

This might be a GREAT REFRESHER for people who already learned and kind a need to refresh their knowledge but as a new beginner - especially for some sections - a more in depth look would have done wonders. Maybe if there was one website to go with it to build on top of each other and enough practice materials that would have been great. 

As a free resource I do understand the amount of effort behind this video, I appreciate it but from a beginners perspective - we need to elarn faster hence the existence of AI - I think I will need to look elsewhere to better understand CSS with more visuals and more emphasis on the WHY rather than just what it does, cause there will come a time where we will need to know why we use a specific css over another. I might change my comment as I am not ready to give up yet but I hope it gets better from a learner's point."	2024-03-17T10:57:57Z	Neutral

7786	2024-01-27T15:48:20Z	@weixintoo5939	OXGznpKZ_sA	Many thanks to Dave and FreeCodeCamp for this CSS course. I've finally completed all the lessons within 2 weeks and I learned a lot from this course. This course indeed covers the basics of CSS that got me started with some projects, especially the one in Frontend Mentor. It is also very nice to learn how to organize CSS so that it won't get messy as we code =)	2024-01-27T15:48:20Z	Positive

7940	2023-07-07T05:48:52Z	@kdakan	OXGznpKZ_sA	This is a good CSS tutorial. But I would be happy to use CSS if half of the features, which rather seem like hacks, were dropped. Something like 'CSS the good parts', similar to 'JS the good parts' book which is 1/10 the size of a JS manual. When there is multiple ways to reach a goal, to toolset is not well designed, and this creates accidental complexity and mental blocks. I can always learn CSS and not reach anywhere, I know I will forget about it in a year, search for some bootstrap hack instead, because it is easier and has become an accepted standard people want to see on pages and apps.	2023-07-07T05:54:53Z	Positive

When it gets too small, the horizontal scroll bar shows up and the right side of the card gets cut off. I can 'solve' this annoyance by putting a right margin on the card of 20px, big enough to cover the vertical scroll bar so the full card is always displayed, but the horizonal scroll bar shows up. How can one style to avoid that horizontal scroll bar. I could not find any vh units in the angular style sheet (which is HUGE!!!).	2023-05-01T12:46:34Z	Neutral

I have a little problem, Sir

My computer crashed and I got a new one and had to download VS code to start all over again but when I got to the flexbox and added the ""gap"" rule to separate the boxes, it didn't work 
Surprisingly, it worked on the former VS code I once used on the spoilt PC. 
I'm having this thought that maybe there's a  revised edition of the codes that nullified the use of the ""gap"" rule and have added another. 

I'm kinda confused about this and I want to get it through 

I need assistance on this

The state of the anchor element is independent of the order, so why can't the hover pseudo class work when the mouse hovers over the link regardless of order? It's like the state of the element isn't recognized anymore because of the order in CSS. I'm probably not the only one who's confused by this.	2022-11-09T16:42:10Z	Neutral

This has improved my learning speed and has given me confidence.	2022-10-12T16:35:02Z	Neutral

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 12 btc from day tradng with Bradley James Holly insights and charts.

8264	2022-08-30T15:47:54Z	@xliquidflames	OXGznpKZ_sA	"It blows my mind how far HTML and CSS have come. I started teaching myself about web design in the early 90s. Right click> view source. I would spend hours pouring over notepad screens tweaking and modifying other people's HTML. Eventually, I was writing my own from scratch.

Then, one day, I came across one that had the CSS tags in the header. Back then, CSS was just an easy way to change the colors and fonts of every page on a site by changing one file. It made things so much easier.

It still does that but now it does _so much_ more. Browsers are so much more sophisticated than IE and Netscape Navigator 3.

I didn't keep up with it. I stopped learning in the early aughts when I was tinkering with Macromedia Flash and Actionscript. This course is exactly what I've been looking for to get me back up to speed with CSS. I'm bookmarking this video to use as a reference."	2022-08-30T15:48:20Z	Positive

Build a workspace with one or more Roots with each root node allowing only a sub-set of the file system underneath.   2.  Get VSCode to build tags (whatever it is called) in the background so that lookups of symbol definitions is fast. I felt VSCode is many times slower than vim.  3. Show definitions of of symbols such as structs, macros, functions, etc in POPUP ballons rather than open them in a separate editor window.  If VSCode can't do them is there another code editor that can do it.	2021-12-25T02:25:48Z	Neutral

I notice the complicated software is free, but to learn how to use it, websites want you to pay them. On other editors, auto fill for tags and such is a simple click in the menu. here, you have to download an extension, and good luck trying to even find it, let alone use it. Everything takes you to this Json section and you need ot understand it's coding to set the extension up. I think they made this extremely complicated just to make cash off of instructions. Just like scrivener for authors. Leave it to Gates to find another angle to make a buck..	2021-01-13T13:43:30Z	Neutral

BTW IF YOU WANNA KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT VS CODE

# check out spell checker 
# check out inbuild jyptr notebook for python
# check out the auto linters 
# MOST IMPORTANT one you can RUN LINIX kernel on top of WINDOWS and can be easily accessed by VS code too 
So you can run Powershell , CMD and BASH on VS code.

Having done training on software for a while now, I’d suggest (at least initially) showing the application without any add-ons/extensions. It’s kinda distracting when your screen doesn’t match what someone learning it from scratch sees. I’ve been using it for a while and I keep seeing things I want it to do; it’s like every few minutes, I yell “SQUIRREL!” It also makes it hard to know if a user has missed a step, has a configuration wrong, or just doesn’t have the extension you’re using.

My feedback about this course:

Amazing tutorial about basics of JS, every minute of this video is worth it. You get to learn a lot as beginner but before taking this course I feel you need to know complete basics of JS like variables, functions, if else and to certain extent you must know DOM as well. 

Only when you have learnt about the basics proceed to this lecture else you might take little bit more time thats all.

All the best to those who are learning this"	2024-03-29T09:35:15Z	Positive

I've even purchased courses on Udemy, but I struggled to grasp JavaScript and became increasingly frustrated. Since I aspire to learn React, I realized that understanding JavaScript is crucial. Thanks to this course, I am finally comprehending JavaScript concepts and enjoying the learning process. It's truly remarkable how a slight shift in the course's approach can have such a significant impact on the learner. If anyone is hesitant about trying this course, I strongly encourage giving it a chance. The best part is that it's completely free. It's hard to believe that a free course could provide exactly what I needed. I'm so relieved	2023-05-31T23:52:24Z	Positive

I completely followed through, it took me like 1 week to complete (like 30mins - 2 hrs per day) and now I am able to start making smaller projects, such as a stopwatch, password generator etc. I really loved how we also learn about API, in the google chrome extension part. would highly recommend it if you got 0, and I mean 0 coding experience	2023-04-23T23:59:17Z	Neutral

There are tons of videos about JS, perhaps given by ace class Master however in teaching being a subject matter expert (SME) is not enough. The span of teaching consists of three phases, 1) teacher/instructor (T/INS) should be SME; 2) T/INS should be able to explain a concept; 3) T/INS must be able to motivate student/learner. Most of the videos I had seen were not passing the 2nd phase. This guy, with this video, is on the way to the 3rd phase (considering the E-learning environment) I strongly recommend him as a T/INS, bravo!!!	2023-04-13T05:37:23Z	Positive

That mistake was following my course curriculum and jumping right into jQuery. I didn't know the first thing about the basics of native JS. Over the years, I'd picked up on tidbits of native JS. But I couldn't say I am a intermediate or expert JS developer.

Fast forward 10 years at the time of this writing, I'm looking to become a React JS developer. Wordpress and PHP have become quite a nuisance. I don't want anything to do with either anymore. It's imperative to have native JS skills in order to get anywhere with React.

I had taken about 65% of Freecodecamp Python full tutorial, so that definitely helped me understand basics like variables, etc, but you don't need to do that in order to succeed in this course. Per breaks everything down step by step, and unlike a lot of tutorials that just explain things, Per has you building and practicing programs alongside the tutorial, so you truly get a hands-on learning experience. While I learned a LOT, I feel like I just scratched the surface. I just subscribed to the 6-month front-end career path on Scrimba to go all the way down the rabbit hole. Thank you Per for this excellent, free course to get me into programming! You have earned my business.	2023-01-05T18:10:47Z	Positive

I watched it 3 weeks ago and did not understand anything. But now I'm learning everything on this video. How?
Because I realized that to learn from such big tutorials you need to learn the ""basic of the basic"" first.
There aren't many tutorials that teach the very beginners like myself. Fortunately I was able to find an AWESOME book, it's called ""Javascript in Less Than 50 Pages"", I recommend it to anyone who is a very beginner, before start watching any big tutorial.

As someone who struggles with ADHD, this course was definitely efficient at keeping me engaged and wanting to learn.

Per provides a fun and relaxing environment to learn in. I still can't believe how much information I was able to effectively consume.
Better still, I feel like I've actually retained it in a useful way. Per's teaching method definitely requires you to develop a strong muscle memory.

I still needed to go back and look at a previous lesson for help, Google for answers or watch Per's solutions to understand at times, but I definitely was
able to figure out a lot more on my own than I normally am when I try to learn new things.

Also if you are new to programming the course teacher teaches very nicely that you will understand everything but still I think some topics are left to be covered but enough for the beginners. The course best part is its interactive environment in scrimba and the project at last which are not available in this youtube part.

Though my display and styling was awful 😂😂  If you are a newbie like me just pause the video whenever a challenge is posed and try to think. Think from the perspective of the computer and not from how we're used to. If you are using Vscode just type ""log"" instead of ""console.log""  you'll get suggestions and that will save you some seconds.

I was totally blown away by how he goes over every step of the way through out the course and I felt very confident  towards the end. Actually I learnt more than just JavaScript from this course. i.e, how to actually learn a new language(by actually working on a live project) and how not to be too overwhelmed by so many new concepts & Terminologies.  He breaks down every single step and trains you so well. The 7+ Hr video is definitely worth the time as he goes over 2 Projects. Knowing Python or Java/ C++ will make the learning much easier though not required. However some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS are required.

Just starting out JS just a week ago with a Udemy course tho I love the instructor there but at the beginning it's quiet hard to grasp on fundamentals by only theory based lecture.

I have some courses that I bought on Udemy and dropped them because they were boring, way too much theory and a very low number of exercises, making it so that when I reached an exercise I already forgot everything or didn't know how to use what I learned to solve the exercise. This course was great from start to finish, 95% of classes have exercises, by the end of it I was confident that I truly learned everything that was taught.	2022-02-13T15:54:24Z	Positive

9877	2021-12-09T14:53:45Z	@Esb0na	jS4aFq5-91M	"3 days after its release, this video was my introduction to web development. 2 weeks ago I started my first job as a full stack developer. Work hard and never give up!

Edit almost 2 years after:
*For the skeptics*
I was really ecstatic when I made this comment so I might have overlooked a few things. I see some of you did not believe me, and I think it is good to be skeptic about things you read on the internet. However, the comment was true. Seven months after my first line of code, I was hired as a full stack developer at age 21.
Now the caveats. 
Number 1: I am a physics dropout so you could say I had a math and problem-solving background. However, I wasn't really good at physics, that's why I dropped out to be a dev.
Number 2: when I said ""work hard and never give up""(in retrospect it sounds super corny), I really mean it. I was full blown 8-10 hours a day learning to code. Even most weekends. I missed going out with my friends or going o vacation or whatever. Also, I had the privilege of having that time, as I was studying and living with my parents. And also, I kind of gambled here, because I dropped out without telling my parents, so if I failed I would have lost a full year of college which was very risky and they wouldn't have been very proud.
Number 3: Today the job market is more difficult than 2 years ago. However, don't get disappointed as those things tend to be cyclic and it should get better.
So to conclude I would say that maybe depending on your situation and how much dedication you want to put to it, you may be able to land a job after 1-1.5 years of studying

*For the ones who want resources*
Many asked for resources and roadmaps
I recommend 2 things that were useful for me. Firstly, as you did in this tutorial, build projects. Even if they are fully copied from another person. It will help you understand.
Also, now I will give you a mini roadmap. It will be order, but if you get bored of something, you may skip it and return afterwards. You might not grasp fully concepts when you skip something important, but it is better to be a bit confused but entertained than to call it quits.
Google any concept you don't understand
0. Learn git. Very important.
1. Fully understand javascript and ES6 as much as possible. 
2. Get into the basics of react, node and express and build some small projects where you consume REST APIs from a React SPA. You should eventually learn to use a react state manager such as redux or zustand.
3. Learn a database. I started with MongoDB which is quite good and free to deploy in MongoAtlas. You can use the mongoose ORM to interact with the DB from nodejs. I recommend you eventually learn SQL though as it is really powerful (I recommend PostgreSQL)
4. Learn TypeScript. Do not skip this, it is extremely important
5. Learn authentication via JWT in express.
6. Learn the Next.js framework.
7. Learn to deploy on Netlify and Vercel for free.
8. Build an app that will look good on your resume, try to make it something useful.
9. Learn websockets. How to communicate with socketio from node to react.
10. This is no longer programming, but build a good CV, search how to make it pass ATS, make it eyecatching, highlight your skills and apps you made. I didn't but you can make a portfolio. Definitely make a LinkedIn account and connect with other tech people. Have an appropriate picture, add your skills and education or work experience if you have it.
11. Study leetcode. You will probably get some programming challenges in your job interviews so be prepared. Also learn soft skills you can use for non technical questions you will be asked in the interview
12. Learn Agile Methodologies such as SCRUM and learn to use JIRA(recruiters will love that, I promise)
Now you're ready to start applying to everything. I applied to about 50 jobs and got 2 interviews. In both I did really good. You will get few chances with no experience, so do not waste them.
While you're looking for a job, you can learn more really useful technologies. I recommend Docker, GraphQL, basic AWS, nginx, Nest.js, React Native, maybe other framework other than react or other language other than javascript. But, more importantly get deeper knowledge of everything you learned before.

I can't handle resources on here because can't post urls on yt comments. However, if you want to ask me for resources or anything about programming, DM me at instagram, i'm grego_kun.

Once you've learned how to use the 'onclick' property with the button element, why not create a temporary button  on your app specifically for control-logging anything you need to debug.  You can create a function in JS and have console.log() inside of it. Link that to your button, and then whenever you need to console log something, like in the exercises for example, you can just enter the required variable inside console.log() within your function, and then click the button on your app, and, VOILA, console-logged!  

It's not necessary but it's a nice touch and then you won't have to keep on typing out console.log() for each exercise.  It's also a fun exercise in itself.  You can always remove the button later when your app is complete."	2021-12-01T11:23:45Z	Positive

Edit to add: I really disliked the lack of continuity on Scrimba (each time I played the video my code seemed to dissapear). I'll be switching to coding along independently to this video in VSCode. I'll provide another update.

And stop complaining that the model isnt a senior dev the world has 7 billion people how many senior devs are there.
A lot of the time you'd want to build yourself a custom gpt because there you can set clear constraints + add reference materials that are refed in often. they do wonders. building a custom gpt yourself is especially true when you're building a coding helper tool. Simply because gpt is quite forgetful and can quickly start forgetting details here and there. the pdf files that you add are refreshed often in between prompts which helps with maintaining RAM-like memory for gpt to work on every time. Else as i said, it'll start forgetting so many details its annoying.

10462	2024-03-18T01:51:46Z	@FHL1314	_ZvnD73m40o	"Here are some extra smart tips on prompt engineering that are practical:

- Embrace the Socratic method: Instead of asking direct questions, break down your prompts into a series of leading questions that guide the model towards the desired output.

- Leverage few-shot learning: Provide a few examples of the desired input-output pairs before the actual prompt. This can significantly improve the model's understanding and performance.

- Employ recursive re-writing: Feed the model's output back into itself as a new prompt, allowing it to iteratively refine and improve its responses.

- Utilize prompt chaining: Break down complex tasks into a sequence of smaller prompts, where the output of one prompt becomes the input for the next.

- Explore prompt augmentation: Supplement your prompts with additional context, such as relevant background information, constraints, or examples of what not to do.

- Experiment with prompt ensembling: Combine the outputs of multiple prompts or models to create a more robust and diverse final output.

- Leverage prompt-based fine-tuning: Fine-tune language models on a small dataset of prompts and desired outputs, tailoring them for specific tasks or domains.

- Incorporate prompt-based retrieval: Use prompts to query and retrieve relevant information from external sources, effectively augmenting the model's knowledge.

- Explore prompt-based translation: Translate prompts into different languages or styles, potentially unlocking new perspectives or capabilities.

- Leverage prompt-based reasoning: Guide the model to perform multi-step reasoning or problem-solving by breaking down complex tasks into a series of prompts."	2024-03-18T01:51:46Z	Neutral

It is almost never about just typing text into ChatGPT better or making great prompts one at a time. Nobody I know is hiring people to do that.  The engineering part of this is application development that takes  user input in an application and then dynamically creates prompts using other data.... like customer specific information  For example,  a prompt engineer may be asked to upgrade a CRM application so that when the user asks a question, it takes previous purchases and uses that data to create a prompt to pass along to ChatGPT 4.  That is prompt engineering. Too many people miss the importance of the dynamic nature of prompts and think of it as an end user using ChatGPT .  That isn't what it is about at all.	2024-02-28T19:04:47Z	Neutral

For example a company like AT&T might hire a prompt engineer that will take user input from a chat and then wrap that input with appropriate domain knowledge and context.    A company making a language learning application might want to hire a prompt engineer to design prompts that take the level of the student, the language they are learning, their previous history in using the application, and then create prompts that will take users to the next level.

This video I think completely misses the context for what prompt engineering means as it relates to employable opportunities.  You need to know how to use the API and construct prompts programatically using domain specific knowledge."	2024-02-28T18:55:04Z	Positive

It can continue the complexity of the metaphors to a ridiculous degree, while maintaining translational conceptual accuracy.

Edit: It did this with no explanation of the disparate concepts. I input language in similar bracketed hmtl conceptually-contained chunks, using tab spacing and descending/ascending prioritization of macro-micro contained concepts.

Are there rules? For those who don't believe in double standards, give it a try to see the results. You will be suprised. AI algorithms are a set of instructions or rules that enable machines to learn, analyze data, and make decisions based on that knowledge.There will be good AI tools and bad ones to use. We need to have consensus on the set of instructions and rules for machine to learn organically and holistically. From my humble point of view, ChatGPT is deeply biased, and may be not always good for social science study/science/education/research and more.

1. Start with a Clear Goal: Begin by defining your objective or what you want to achieve.

2. Be Specific: Specify the type of information or response you're looking for.

3. Provide Clear Instructions: Write detailed prompts with correct grammar.

4. Don't Assume that the AI Knows What You're Thinking. For example, instead of writing, ""When is the election?"" which implies that you expect the AI to know what election and country you're referring to, write be more specific, like ""When is the next presidential election in Poland?""

5. Add a Personality to Your Prompts. For instance, write a poem as if it were composed by Helena, a 25-year-old writer with a writing style similar to the famous 21st-century poet Rupi Kaur. Write a poem for her 18-year-old sister's high school graduation, capturing the style of Rupi Kaur, as if it were Helena's creation.

6. Set Limits for Lengthy Topics. For instance, specify a maximum of 50 words for responses on lengthy topics.

7. If the AI Requires Additional Information, Provide It. For example, if you're asking about ""Omar's favorite food,"" and the AI doesn't know who Omar is, you can provide context like, ""My friend Omar loves to eat pizza and burgers. We will visit America, so could you recommend the best places to eat that may Omar would love?"	2023-10-05T08:56:27Z	Positive

Chapter 1: The Enchanted Letter

It was a crisp autumn day in the wizarding world, and Albus Severus Potter, the youngest son of Harry Potter, was heading to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The train station was bustling with young witches and wizards, all eager to embark on their magical journey.

As Albus boarded the scarlet Hogwarts Express, he couldn't help but feel the weight of his family legacy. His father, Harry, had been a hero in the wizarding world, and his older brother, James, had already made a name for himself as a Quidditch star. Albus, however, had always felt like the odd one out.

The train ride was uneventful until a tattered envelope slipped under the compartment door. Albus picked it up, and his heart raced as he read the words: ""Help me, Albus Potter. You're my only hope.""

Curiosity piqued, Albus opened the envelope to find a mysterious map and a letter written in elegant script. The letter explained that the map was the Marauder's Map, which had been updated with a hidden chamber within Hogwarts itself. The chamber was said to contain a powerful artifact known as the Phoenix's Tear, capable of granting immense magical abilities.

Chapter 2: The Secret Chamber

Unable to resist the call of adventure, Albus enlisted the help of his closest friends, Rose and Scorpius. Together, they began their quest to find the Phoenix's Tear. The Marauder's Map led them through hidden passageways and secret rooms within Hogwarts, testing their wits and courage.

As they delved deeper into the castle's mysteries, they discovered that the chamber had been sealed for centuries and was guarded by enchantments of the highest order. Albus, Rose, and Scorpius faced numerous challenges, from riddles to magical creatures, as they inched closer to their goal.

Chapter 3: The Phoenix's Tear

After months of searching and overcoming obstacles, the trio finally reached the heart of the chamber. There, they found a majestic phoenix guarding a magnificent jewel--the Phoenix's Tear. Albus knew he had to prove his worth to claim it.

With courage and determination, Albus approached the phoenix and extended a hand. The phoenix gazed deep into his eyes and saw the bravery and integrity within his soul. It allowed him to take the tear, and as Albus held it in his hand, he felt a surge of incredible power.

Chapter 4: The Final Battle

Word of their discovery spread throughout Hogwarts, and it reached the ears of a dark wizard who sought to use the Phoenix's Tear for nefarious purposes. A final battle loomed as Albus, Rose, and Scorpius prepared to defend the artifact and the world from darkness.

In a climactic showdown, the trio faced the dark wizard and his followers, using the newfound powers of the Phoenix's Tear to protect Hogwarts. Albus, channeling the courage and strength of his family, defeated the dark wizard and sealed the chamber once more, safeguarding the Phoenix's Tear.

Chapter 5: The Legacy Continues

With the Phoenix's Tear now protected and the dark threat vanquished, Albus, Rose, and Scorpius returned to their studies at Hogwarts, knowing that they had played a part in preserving their world's safety.

As Albus looked out over the Hogwarts grounds, he realized that he had found his own path and purpose, separate from his famous family. He knew that the legacy of the Potters would continue to shape the wizarding world, but he was determined to make his own mark.

And so, the adventures of Albus Severus Potter, Rose Weasley, and Scorpius Malfoy continued, as they forged their own destinies and faced the challenges of a world that still held many secrets and surprises.

In the end, it was not just the name ""Potter"" that carried the weight of heroism, but the actions, choices, and courage of each new generation that ensured the wizarding world remained safe and magical."	2023-09-18T16:41:58Z	Positive

> It is about clarity, with that I mean that AI is not a human to whom we general ""Indirect ask something to do"". Therefore, we can directly come to point and ask. My point is that don't hesitate to directly ask Ai to do, get, produce or explain something.

> Personality: as mentioned in the above course, Ai is just made of bunch of ""if else"" conditions, So we should make it know like whom, how, what it is supposed to give info or produce of.

> Another thing i noticed that it not necessary that we should give it very simplified prompt so that it does our work as not like human, It is machine so we can more elaborate our prompt. I know we that, but still..

>  You can be greedy with Ai as its not human, its alright. Don't Hesitate

> Most Important - Prompt Engineering is a just buzz word. its not that hard (just to encourage)

Not even so much the solutions themselves, but what their search looks like. It's just great!

I'm just studying the frontend now, but let me make a couple of observations.

Regarding the toggle - I rather percept it as a regular button (press to activate dark mode, and press to deactivate) - like a button on a flashlight. In the radiobutton case it must be two visible labels here without any options. And if its a button - the button label have to do the same work - activate/deactivate the dark mode - is the most logical behavior of this element on the page. So I implemented it this way - it could be a <span> inside <button> pushed outside by ""position: relative"" or it could be a <lable> for <button> - that's simplier to stylize.

In JS it seems to be better realization it you keep and pay attention whether the user has ever changed the color theme mannually or not: if yes - in the future we ignore the system settings, if not - we always follow the operating system.

Also it seems for me that every card in the page should be not just <div>, but rather a link - if it's hoverable - it's for sure clickable and also have to be navigated by tab (replacing <div> by <a> is a better decistion then inject ""tabindex"" into every div manually).

A few things didn't work for me on my pc setup.   It might be because I am in Linux instead of Windows.
- Firefox did not display the styled checkboxes (just the default look).  The styled checkboxes displayed correctly in other browsers.
- Installing the Chrome Vox extension in Chromium, the voice (oddly, as it seems to be the point of the extension) did not work.   Just got sounds on clicking tabs, etc.
- Could not find the Live Sass Compliler in the vs code extensions on the vs code version I have installed.   However, I already had Sass on my system previously, and just manually (command line) started the sass watch command."	2020-11-14T22:48:17Z	Neutral

11194	2024-02-05T13:53:44Z	@Tachiguro	RGOj5yH7evk	"I like the slow tutorial, so you can follow it. But sadly there are a lot of wrong expaination. It is a good practice to understand the topic, if you are explaining it.
Some examples: 
1. ""la"" is not a command on a mac it is just an alias probably added with ""Oh my zsh!"", you can create your own aliases in in UNIX like Os very easy, type ""alias --help"" to get more information about it.
2. ""Because it's blue it means it's a folder"" This is in hers situation right because she uses ""Oh my zsh!"" with this kind of theme there are a lot of different themes for ""Oh my zsh!"" by the way you can also beautify your bash with ""Oh my bash!"" but for everyone else: if you use ""ls -l"" you will get the content of a folder and if the first sighn in the line is a ""d"" so it is a directory, you can learn more about ls just type: ""man ls""
3. ssh key: you email don't need to be the same you just need the key... you can learn more about ssh-keygen just type: ""man ssh-keygen""
By the way you should learn as first to use the man pages type ""man man"" to learn more. man pages are documentation about programs or functions. Not every program has a page in man pages but a lot of them. you can even search in terminal for a program|command just type ""apropos <what you searching for>""
Probably I should make a tutorial..."	2024-02-05T13:53:44Z	Positive

For one thing, GitHub has changed a bit since this video was made.  But the real show stopper is that you are 90% devoted to Mac and I'm using Windows.  It's hard enough for some people to learn new things, let alone, trying to convert commands to different operation systems.	2023-11-18T01:39:36Z	Neutral

Quick question at 55:37 you merged with master while staying on quick-test(sub-branch), it didn't bring any changes to the master branch. So what I meant to ask is if I to bring changes into my master branch I should do the opposite right!?

1. This video was created 3yrs ago, the GitHub was not yet advanced compared to how it is now. Yes I have Github account thanks to this video

2. Visual Studio Code is also advanced because there's an option that allows you to clone without going to the terminal. You simply copy the address of the repository you want to clone in Github and past it on the address box on VSCode.

Which makes the video to be outdated given the fact that VSC and Github have advanced since this video was shot. I struggled until I saw the differences between Github 2023 Sep 16 and the one used in the video(3yrs ago). Same applies for VSC, it is so advanced thanks to the developers of Microsoft

1. it would have been super helpful to show how to set up ssh earlier on. I struggled because I had never set up an SSH key in GitHub and the way the tutorial is laid out it is unclear how to set up SSH. I found my answer on stack overflow however.

2. how do you get your terminal to be set up like that where it shows the branch? my terminal doesn't show anything to indicate I am in git or which branch I am in (not in VS code and not in terminal either). 

thanks again!"	2023-06-17T03:38:35Z	Positive

I believe I accidentally typed in:  git add . (dot) which then added every subdir + files into git as untracked.  Not good as I now have many, many dirs & files in untracked status.  I did not do a commit (thank gawd).  So, i tried all kinds of combos of:  git clean;  git clean -fd & git rm --cached on just a few files or on a subdir/files (backed up of course) and found that these commands actually delete the file on disk along with untracked files in the work area.  This is really bad.  So how do I back out of this predicament? Here is an example.  Each dir ha many files:

$ git status -s

?? ../Javascript/
?? ../SquareAPI/
?? ../Project X/

My  goal is to be able to setup a git repository with all of the bash aliases and scripts that I want in a repo so that when I setup new devices I can clone all that without futzing around with usb sticks and such.

git add vs git commit
----------------------------------
- ""git add"" sends a modified file in your working repository to the staging area; files are NOT committed
- ""git commit"" saves files from the staging area; takes a snapshot of your repository's current state, and creates a new revision with a log. each version has a unique identifier.

commit vs push
--------------------------
- commit only saves files locally 
- push sends committed (saved) files to a [specified] remote repository

working directory --> staging area --> local repository --> remote repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
working directory files are sent to the staging area via ""git add"". 
staging area files are added and saved to your local repository via ""git commit"".
local repository files are added to a remote repository via ""git push"".

the rabbit hole is deep. Happy new years!

(19:15) committing     *** MUST INCLUDE DESCRIPTION ***
(20:20) [[command git push]] to push files to git
(20:30) SSH Keys
	<21:45> Search for KEY.	
	<22:47> [[command ~cat testkey.pub]]  to print the key
	<23:00> To copy key.

(30:21) Review workflow so far: 
(31:40) Compare between GitHub workflow and local git workflow
(32:42) git branching
	<36:15> FullScreenTerminal (same as VSCode)
	<36:55> 
	<39:45> In VSCode - 'M' next to the file name means it has been modified, but not updated to GITHUB.
	<40:54> Merging 
	<43:25> PULL REQUEST (PR): Request to have code pulled onto other branch.
	<44:28> How to go to the URL
		<44:30>	URL via GITHUB interface.

			<53:32> [[git diff master]] ** Check difference - this shows the changes
		<53:38> Merge
		<53:50> Master gets updated as you work; 
		<54:35> Merge Conflict
			<54:45> Interface (like GitHub) give you ways to fix it.
			<54:52>	Easiest way to fix merge conflicts is directly in your code (i.e. VSCode).
			<55:05> VSCode will give you buttons: Example accept changes; or you can do it manually.
		<55:50> Go back to Terminal
			<56:00> Need to make a commit because we have fixed the merge conflicts.
			<56:05> [[git commit -am ""updated with master""]]
(56:30) Undoing in git
	<56:45> In VSCode made error.

		<01:00:25> [[command git reset HASHoftheCOMMIT10018709487301987410]]
		<01:00:35> VSCode - changes are still there - but not saved to GIT, or staged to GIT any longer.
		<01:00:50> What if testing and want to delete after a few commits.

(1:01:50) Forking in git
	(1:03:40) Working on larger projects - create multiple branches - master, staging, dev.
	(1:04:32) To get changes from my fork to main repository create PULL REQUEST
	(1:05:18) To merge fork within my fork.
 	(1:06:14) After merging a branch - we could delete branch from GITHUB and local machine.

Still, when I saw your video with a high number of likes and positive comments, I thought to give it a try and to my surprise, you are that one in 1000. You are awesome!!! Even better than a male tutor this time.	2022-06-29T06:05:03Z	Neutral

12021	2022-06-27T20:20:43Z	@josephklem8105	RGOj5yH7evk	This is the best explanation I've seen so far -- thanks! I'm still a little unclear on which option to choose if I want to offer a very small edit to someone else's repo, like an edit to their README.md. Seems like I could clone the repo, fork the repo, or even just make an edit directly on their Github repo (creating a branch and a pull request, if alllowed on their repo.) That last option seems simplest, and doesn't even require me to do anything locally. Is that correct?	2022-06-27T20:20:43Z	Neutral

I didnt quiet clearly get the actual key name should be left blank inorder to create it in its default name. ~/.ssh/id_rsa. 21:40. Now if I go back and search ls  ~/.ssh ,I can see id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. 2. Also if you are using Mac, you may not see ~/.ssh/config under ~/.ssh and thats ok. Go ahead and create it and add the three line as shown in 24:38. I just didnt catch these two points while creating the SSH keys. Only after all this, you can start Git clone 15:02.	2022-06-19T06:18:38Z	Neutral

My github account was created pre-2020 so I believe I'm having issues with branches. Basically; when I created the demo-repo2 local directory everything was working fine until I got to the 'git push -u origin main' step. I was getting an error basically saying main was undefined or something along those lines. I tried using 'git push -u origin master' and it successfully pushed it according to CLI. If I check git status it shows no changes available.

HOWEVER - When I go to that repository on github it still shows as an empty repository; the changes are not appearing to push there. I ran 'git branch' from the demo-repo2 folder on my local vscode client and it shows 'master' as the branch. When I do the same from the 'demo-repo' dir I created earlier in the video it shows 'main' as the branch... so I've managed to end up with a main and master branch, and I don't know how to correct this issue. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"	2022-03-06T22:26:28Z	Neutral

Thanks for a great intro.
Two questions in relation to collaboration via Forking:
- When you fork I understand it as you are detached from updates to the main project.
Q1 - You mention deleting a branch when your PR has been accepted. Should you not delete the entire local forked Repo and Fork again for the next update - so when doing the next update you are sure to have the latest version of Master/Dev?
Q2 - Is there a way ""smarter way"" to update a fork to contain the most recent branch from the original repo, perhaps even an automatic setting such that your remote master/dev branches are always up to date ?

Thanks again

Edit: Upon reviewing the tutorial again, I'd like to say:

1. When creating a tutorial, you guys should _truly_ understand the importance of slowing down to the pace of the learner. In the beginning you walk us through a nice set of key terms (which was exceptional), then start mixing lots of advanced and beginner-level concepts together in your explanations, confusing the person that's watching the video. Slow down, explain like we're 5, that's why we're here.

2. To expand upon the issue of mixing things up I mentioned above, it's okay to keep a tutorial short, and add footnotes later if you think that the advanced concepts you're touching on are still worth being aware of. That way, the beginner can truly focus their attention on the basics, and then access the footnote only when they feel comfortable with the knowledge they've acquired thus far, making the content of your footnotes even more effective. After all, isn't good programming about being efficient? 

I used to get annoyed at being expected to take additional English classes as a Computer Science student, but now I understand why. I spent 4 hours yesterday debugging a Terminal issue, only to later realize that there was an ""issue"" because the person who created the how-to GitHub document instructed the reader to paste this code into the Terminal command line: 

*eval ""$(ssh-agent exec -s)""*

They said to *paste* this command in the terminal (meaning: include the quotation marks). After 4 hours of learning about chmod, File Links, Groups, root directory, Inodes—things I knew NOTHING about prior to this, I resolved my problem by simply removing the quotation marks. 

Now, the arrogant developer might say, ""Well that's obvious"". No it's not! The person said ""paste"", meaning I would: 

- Select the piece of code
- Apply ctrl+c to it, for Windows (cmd+c on Mac)
- Go to the Terminal and apply ctrl+v/cmd+v

Either the tutorial should have been made like this: 

*eval $(ssh-agent exec -s)* ,  

or the person writing the document should I mentioned that the quotation marks need to be removed. 

As Software Engineering becomes more collaborative, programmers can no longer get away with being asocial, and communication impaired, so this is an area a lot more engineers need to start being proficient in ."	2021-11-08T15:21:02Z	Neutral

I can't clone. I can list folders ... trying to figure it out now ...

Update 1: It magically worked the 2nd time for some reason. Now the error is I can't connect to my github due to no access due to lack of Publich SSH key ...

Update 2: Figured out the SSH problem via Youtube Indian guy tutorial. Still couldn't follow along the video

Update 3: The terminal was defaulting to Powershell instead of Bash for me. Once I figured that out and switched to Bash, I could continue following along. What a journey.

""git is not recognized as an internal or external command""

So I followed instruction from stackoverflow - to correctly set PATH in Windows 10 to point at Git installation:

1. Go to My Computer => Local Disk(C:) => Program Files => Git => cmd
2. Right Click the git => Select Properties and copy cmd path location
3. Come back and in the Start Menu or taskbar search, search for ""environment variable"".
4. Select ""Edit the system environment variables"".
5. Click the ""Environment Variables"" button at the bottom.
6. Double-click the ""Path"" entry under ""System variables"".
7. With the ""New"" button in the PATH editor, add previously copied CMD path to the end of the list.
8. Press OK
9. Close and re-open your command prompt.


Easy way to avoid messing with PATH variables in the first place is to re-install Git 
and select ""Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"" 
(NOT ""Use Git from Git Bash only"")"	2021-07-22T09:28:51Z	Neutral

It is extremely difficult to determine the mathmatical relationship, as that seed is destroyed during key creation; however, if you have both keys it is simple to solve.  The simplest explanation that everyone can understand is ""You can only read messages encrypted with one key using the other key.  Because everyone has access to the public key, everyone can read messages encrypted with the private key.  Conversely, a message encrypted using the public key can only be read by someone who has the private key.  That's why it is critical to keep private keys secure."""	2021-06-18T14:16:54Z	Neutral

Another highly appreciable thing is the clear voice of Gwen Faraday. Thank you so much for making this tutorial and thank you freecodecamp.org for uploading it.	2021-05-23T06:08:46Z	Positive

Also, a bit advice, it would be better to use one diagram to show the common workflow of git in the merging section(where you merge your commits into the remote master branch and also have the commits in remote master merge into your own local feature branch). it can be confusing by just hands-on demo it.

13017	2021-01-31T07:41:23Z	@rodolfovitangcol450	RGOj5yH7evk	"Business Opportunity in Ruvol

I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  

It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” 

The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play.

HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?

I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0

BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!

It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

You may contact me at:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   

Thanks and God bless!

You can create either a repo live and clone it OR create it locally and 'remote' it from the cli. Is there any difference at all?  I mean should i prefer starting from Github or locally?

Aside from the fact that (as of the date that I'm writting this) ""master"" has been renamed to ""main"", in order to push from a local repository to github, an extra step has been added. It looks like one must now specify (explicitly) on which branch it's located (in this case ""main""). So, now, the total steps to follow, for this particular case, would be:

git remote add origin git@github.com:Username/Repository_Name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

In terminal view, click on the drop down menu and click on ""Select Default shell"" then choose ""Command Prompt"" or ""Git Bash"".

You can add the following code to your settings.json file: ""terminal.integrated.shell.windows"": ""cmd.exe"". This will make the default terminal command prompt.

I knew absolutely nothing about computers. Didn't even know anyone who had one. The computer came with a thick three-ring binder with the title, DOS. I read and reread and reread the entire book until it started to make sense. (The first version of Windows didn't come out until 1985.) In 1985, I bought an early copy of Symantec's Q&A, a (non-Windows) word processor, flat file, and report generator, which relied heavily on keystroke combinations to get things done but was hinting at a graphical interface. I ran a non-profit for many years with Q&A and loved it, such an improvement from WordStar. So, now at 72-years-old, to see CD = Change Directory, I say to myself, ""Hey, I can do this.""

1. How to create a repo locally through the CLI(Command Line Interface) or directly from GITHUB
2. git flow by using the most common commands: git add - git commit and git push/git pull, all of them with their corresponding explanation. What ""origin"", ""remote"" and ""master"" mean.
3. git branching: all the commands involve in that kind of operation as well as best practices.
4. git merging: when we use a ""feature"" branch and it's time to merge to the ""master"" branch  -- PR (Pull Request) on the Github side
5. How to deal with ""conflicts"" when merging.
6. Undoing in git: undoing from the stage area versus undoing if we have committed once or several times.
7. Understanding how and why we fork a repo on github.

13535	2020-05-30T08:07:08Z	@Mantorp86	RGOj5yH7evk	Great turorial 🙂 Maybe you should REBASE feature branch onto master when you want update the feature branch with new commits from master. With rebase you don’t get those trash merge commits that polutes the  feature branch. Or when merging into master you should squash commits to make it more clean 🙂	2020-05-30T08:07:08Z	Positive

It’s true, that Git does make messing thing up difficult, but not impossible.

Especially if you are a Junior Dev and haven’t taken a course like this one.

I am still junior, but I can say that if a team using Git properly, will get many benefits, but....         if the team lacks proper knowledge, then they will have lots of headaches dealing with merge conflicts.

Menu does not open, accordion does not toggle and testimonials arrows do not work from slide to slide.  Offline with server created from VSCode works just fine but kind of puzzling that nothing would work from there.

So after some googling I've come up with this solution:

1. In the web development content, change the class of a row to row--1, should be directly after the START WEB DEVELOPMENT CONTENT comment.
2. Nest this code in services like this:

 .services {

   .row--1 {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;



    @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {        
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
        
        }
    }
}

I don't know if this is the best approach but it works and looks much better in my opinion."	2021-10-22T20:43:04Z	Positive

Here is how:


Based on another video ""Stop using @import with Sass"" I:
1) Created 2 extra files in Components and Sections called ""_index.scss""



2) In Components it contains:
@forward ""animations"";
@forward ""buttons"";
@forward ""mixins"";
@forward ""typography"";
and in Sections:
@forward ""navbar"";
@forward ""intro-section"";
@forward ""companies"";
@forward ""services"";
@forward ""testimonials"";
@forward ""faq"";
@forward ""portfolio"";
@forward ""get-started"";
@forward ""footer"";


3) Then in style.scss I only have:
@use ""custom"";

@use ""Components""; //importing components 
@use ""Sections""; //import sections
(instead of the things in  (0:35:39) Part 3: File structure )

A temporary workaround is to change the rgba to RGBA in uppercase this seems to fix the problem. Sass will ignore the uppercase and CSS will parse it just fine.	2021-08-19T08:59:49Z	Positive

I tried adding the color variables directly into the _navbar file. I even put .menu in the style.css file along with the color variables (dropping $, adding--) in root, and then adding the primary and secondary in .menu and assigning the color values, in order to test...  and still stays white. There are no other .menu classes in the css and I looked at the other classes listed in the relevant HTML but I can't work out why it's not showing the linear-gradient. I'm guessing there is some sort of conflict and it's defaulting to white or transparent. Any hints would be appreciated.	2021-08-14T03:41:25Z	Neutral

Where did you download that from and is it a best practice to manually insert that into your assets folder?

14086	2023-11-17T21:07:56Z	@gijoe13d	2-crBg6wpp0	Hey John, I’m getting a very annoying eslint error in the redux toolkit portion of the tutorial. I can’t figure it out after much searching and reading documentation. It says: Line 1:22 Parsing error: Identifier ‘create Slice’ has already been declared. (1:22)! It started in the very beginning of this section when we set up cartSlice.js. It’s not declared anywhere else that I can find. Just imported and defined once inside of cartSlice.js. It pops up on the browser like an overlay after every save or refresh. If I simply close the overlay the functionality doesn’t work until I refresh the browser. After that it works but when interacting with any button the entire app has those re-render bars popping up while yours in the video doesn’t? Everything still works and this has been a fantastic course! I enjoy your explanations. I’m brushing up on the skills from my boot camp in preparation for the job market. I hate to say it but I have to say it, I’ve learned much more in your course than I did in class! Thank you and I also want to thank Free Code Camp for doing this for all of us! You guys deserve all the love and respect! Thank you!	2023-11-17T21:07:56Z	Neutral

This video is like a good book that once you start reading it, you won't put it down. I am 3 hours into the video and I have learnt tons. I love how John is displaying the different ways of achieving the same result and how he explains his preferred method with his logic supporting it. All other tutorials only show you one way of doing things and that was what had confused me in the past. Thank you @john-smilga!	2023-11-12T00:36:14Z	Neutral

1) Concise and useful.
2) Doesn't make any assumptions about who is ingesting the content.
3) Strikes a great balance between being informative and keeping an overhead view on the material being taught.

On a personal funny note, I found the following quote to be entertaining, ""you can add a hundred divs, who am I to judge"".
I'm from the UK so the word ""div"" can be used to describe brainless individuals and so whilst that always provides me with a smirk, it's even more funny when you consider the quote can be applied to ignoring good semantic HTML code practices.

Anyway, really enjoying the content so far and gaining such a clean understanding of what React has to offer."	2023-06-09T10:53:53Z	Positive

14499	2023-01-21T09:04:22Z	@nadavbensimon1267	ft30zcMlFao	The main problem with those libraries that offer free css is that what they offer is easy to build in css and could replicate in less than 5 minutes,but if you want the complex and the hard to do styling and animations then you have to pay money or do it yourself .the other problem they have is that they stack css classes in top of each other so instead your html element havi g one class with one or 2 selectors to work with it now has 10 classes with 20 different selectors to work with that damage performance for something that could be done in 5 minutes	2023-01-21T09:04:22Z	Neutral

Let's say I'm writing a different colour for H1 in responsive mode. What are the options I have to write the responsive style? 

1-Using standard media queries. 2-Use the tailwind class at the same spot and write the responsive style. 3-Or any other option such as making another code block just to keep the responsive code separate 4-Tailwind already have a different approach for it.

I don't know if this is the ""correct-est"" way, but I did npm init and then it created a package.json for me to use. 

You could also type one out by hand but eh.....

then you do the ""npm install --save-dev vite"", and it will automatically save vite to the package.json

do let us know though if there is a better way"	2023-04-13T22:13:01Z	Positive

Also some flakiness around the Testing Fundamentals click to expand the accordion item after we added div[role=""button""] - test wouldn't work and then would.

The set up for webdriverio and Sauce Labs is different, wdio/sync is not a thing, and Screener has been acquired by Sauce Labs and is now Visual Testing - it's only available to enterprise clients.

-[27:24-27:53]Hitesh introduces typescript series, starts slow, picks up pace later.
-[37:47-38:14]Collaborators can benefit from safety features in code, preventing errors like 'property touppercase does not exist on type number'.
-[39:18-39:51]Vaish introduces a new video on typescript series, focusing on best practices and covering numbers, booleans, strings, and type inference.
-[41:46-42:12]Javascript has limited number-related methods, like toexponential and tolocalestring.
-[44:48-45:15]Using typescript for better code, it detects and prevents errors, ensuring type safety.
-[46:26-46:57]Tutorial on typescript, emphasizing colons and types, urging 70 non-subscribers to subscribe.

[46:57-01:01:02]3. Typescript best practices
-[57:40-58:10]During user sign up, name, email, and password are requested, but they are marked as 'any' type.
-[01:00:16-01:00:51]Discussing passing default values for email and paid in a simple string and boolean format, without encountering any complaints.

[01:01:02-01:14:52]4. Typescript syntax, benefits, and functions overview
-[01:03:16-01:03:44]Typescript emphasizes philosophy of type usage, enhancing javascript.
-[01:03:47-01:04:14]Returning 'hello' instead of a number, a concern for team collaboration.
-[01:06:43-01:07:11]Introduction to handling multiple return types in typescript, using union types, to be discussed in a separate video.

[01:14:52-01:53:31]5. Understanding typescript fundamentals

[01:53:32-02:14:12]6. Typescript union, literal types, and tuples
-[01:55:22-01:55:51]Typescript allows using multiple types of data, such as 334, without causing errors, making it really useful.
-[01:59:26-01:59:54]The code is being checked for lower case and string verification at line number 30.
-[02:05:20-02:05:53]Tuples in typescript are useful but with limitations. caution advised based on stack overflow thread.
-[02:07:29-02:07:58]Converting data into a tuple, including string, number, and boolean types.
-[02:13:04-02:13:51]In a javascript article on stack overflow, a user discusses issues with typescript array push method not handling tuple type arrays, which was posted a year and 11 months ago.

[02:14:13-02:38:48]7. Typescript enums, interfaces, and methods
-[02:15:24-02:15:52]Enums restrict choices in e-commerce orders, e.g., wish list, delivered, shipped, returned.
-[02:27:49-02:28:17]Read-only fields, like a db id, should be numbers, not optional, and filled in. the advantage is similar to past studies.
-[02:29:21-02:29:50]Method must be compulsory and return a string, such as 'trial started.'
-[02:34:43-02:35:16]Integrating a library from github can require adding missing interfaces and files.
-[02:35:39-02:36:08]Adding a github token as a string property and accessing functionality through declared variable or constant is a typescript feature loved by many.

One such case is when the code gets complex enough that to figure out what type it should be requires hunting through multiple files, in this case explicitly typing is a good idea to prevent a change many files away from breaking your code (without throwing error at compilation).

There are other cases, too. So it is generally preferred, but not required, to avoid explicit typing. You will usually know when that is the case."	2023-12-29T02:33:00Z	Neutral

1. Re-Record the entire video to avoid switching your voice from time to time.
2. Need to fix the play logic - On the chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener - The play logic should be:
“youtubePlayer.currentTime = value;” (instead of “youtubePlayer.time = value;”
3. Some parts you paste other videos and miss typing (Like bookmarkBtn.addEventListener('click', addNewBookmarkEventHandler); part - 4. 4. You just later added it back, so there is in-consisting of the code flow of the course).
5. The part of the invalid match is critical for the beginning of the video, I had to refresh 1000 times and didn’t understand why the console log didn't print anything.
6. You need to add a fix on the fetchBookmarks in order to prevent errors when the currentVideo is null:

Thanks a lot for your contribution and I appreciate it.

if id would be an array, can we push values to the array in the case of READONLY?
Answer: Yes. it allows push and pop operations. 

type testId = {
    readonly _id: Array<number>
    name: string
}
let testIdOne: testId = {
    _id: [1, 2, 3],
    name: ""ns""

testIdOne._id.push(4);
testIdOne._id.push(5);

console.log(""result->"", testIdOne);

If someone is able to add SponsorBlock segments to skip all of those and all the fluff, this tutorial would be vastly improved. EDIT: I've started adding section skips from 1h50m onwards, would be great if someone was able to get the sections prior also done.

If you are a more seasoned developer and you just want to make a quick transition to Typescript, I would recommend using another learning tool entirely instead, like an interactive Typescript tutorial online instead, so you can learn at your own pace rather than this video's pace (which is still slow even at 1.5x playback speed).

You create a function ""createUser"", that takes in object with ""name"" and ""isPaid"" properties.
But instead of giving them a type, you destructuring the object 
and reassigning ""name"" to ""string"" and ""isPaid"" to ""boolean"", 
But object itself still has ""any"" type!

function createUser({ name: string, isPaid: boolean }) {} 
Same as:
function createUser({ name: string, isPaid: boolean }: any) {}
Almost same as:
function createUser({ name, isPaid }) {    ---> type is still ""any""
    const string = name
    const boolean = isPaid
}

I think you wanted to to something like this instead: 
function createUser({ name, isPaid }: { name: string, isPaid: boolean }) {}
Or this:
type User = { name: string, isPaid: boolean }
function createUser({ name, isPaid }: User) {}

Y'all can try to code this in typescript playground, if you don't believe me
https://www.typescriptlang.org/play

I mean in case when I store a huge amount of data (it won't be in single file like here) then I need to use for example Postgress db. Then to receive data I have to write SQL queries to get them out. So why not use very specyfic sql query to get data I want and in the same time limit network traffic?From my point of view it looks like we are trying to add for car extra 5th weel for stability. It should be easier but from my perspective is oposite, and higher complexity doesn't give us more speed here. It's going to be slower.	2024-01-14T01:27:12Z	Neutral

15485	2024-02-23T10:30:19Z	@misinokiszuriwalilibori1389	KjY94sAKLlw	Hi Alicia, Hi All. That is really perfect source if you have not worked with Next.js. However, have two comments. 1. This course would be even better if you do not deal with CSS ( I mean it consumes time and distracts attention; If you just add pre-prepared classes it would be just fine). The second would be more serious - you left with app not working in production environment (or not fully working). In fact, the solution in that case is neither simple nor obvious and you gave no hint as per subject. As far as I have seen ( please correct me if I am wrong - I am new to back-end) one can not make persistent changes to files the way it is shown. Things change if you host the app by yourself - but not on Vercel (or at least, not on Vercel free account).	2024-02-23T17:07:01Z	Neutral

At 41:48, when you navigate to route /events/san - it shows the Events in London Page with 6 Sub Heading(h2 probably) elements, when the same route /events/{something} was navigating to the same Events in London Page with 6 anchor tags being displayed side by side. So I'm a bit confused if I missed something. Seems like a glitch in editing the video but just wanted to be sure?

Also, are the routes in the [id].js file supposed to be /events/london/event{n} instead of /events/event{n}?

Thanks again for the amazing tutorial 🤩"	2022-12-29T15:09:38Z	Positive

15599	2022-12-29T03:00:31Z	@lordbacon4972	KjY94sAKLlw	All these new frameworks and libraries are simply reinventing the wheel with different conventions and syntax.  There's no real improvement or innovation, it's simply like a trend in fashion.  Using old-school technologies, having hundreds of different events in different cities is not a problem -- a good developer wouldn't create discrete pages for every combination as well.  They'd just create a single page with variable sections.  All this is possible already using any older existing frameworks.  Again, no ground-breaking improvements here except to that it's the latest trendiest framework/api/library.	2022-12-29T03:00:31Z	Neutral

For example:


'imr + tab' creates import React from 'react'
'sfc' + tab' creates const NameOFComponent =()=>{
     return(

    );
}
export default NameOfComponent; 
sfc - stateless functional component

Aside from this little detail, your video is by far the best react native video I have ever seen. I have searched high and low for a very good comprehensive 'not banging my head against a wall' type of tutorial. 

I also have to commend your approach for how you break down your code in such a way to keep everything tidy and clean. That is the mark of a true developer."	2023-07-07T18:15:56Z	Neutral

After some research, it appears it is only available on IOS devices(v11 or later). Since I am using an Android (v10), I can not use this feature. I have not been able to find another way to fix my problem of the text being blocked by the top phone header. I could probably fix it by adjusting the padding, but as you said in the video, this is not a good idea. Since it will look different on different devices. It should be noted I am using the expo app on my phone (Instead of an emulator) to view the render from react native. Has anyone else found a work around for this? If I figure it out, I will be sure to update my comment with a solution for others."	2023-04-30T16:40:24Z	Neutral

But i hope someone answers me about two point i can't understand seriously.
1 - about server : you said on explain company like google can creat so many servers to get more speed to be faster to response, right, all i want understand whene i share i data (image or video) he uploaded into all this servers or just one of them, i mean the more near to me? Beacuse : if it's the first answer and google uploaded the same data to all servers, that took more time and take more space. If it's not and data transfer only to one server, then the result be the same. Beacuse someon on chine for exemple and he want get responses that took time to travel btween different ips (local > régional > global).
2 : my second question about how wireless work, it's the same like cable or different way, but such firstly i know what's the access point ( if am not wrong i think its whene a router connect with cable and share a access point wireless in same distance) but i mean in this case, the wireless by satellite that Elon mask creat for example?
It's send directly from satellite to near tour to your device or took some structure to response?

I also want to say that I took some notes during the course and I think that it will be useful for people who want a recap every once in a while. That said, its still very important to watch this video, in my opinion as I have only a summary of its content. Anyways here you guys go - hope you will find these notes useful!



			      INTERNET

Switch
To connect different computers in an environment together we can use a switch. To connect all the computers to the switch we can use copper wires or fibre optic cables which are faster. Copper wires can be of two types those are CAT-5 and CAT-6. Category 6 is faster than category 5. The switch has ports on them called LAN ports, they are called LAN ports because switches are the ones that help us in creating a LAN.




Access points
Access points are similar to switches but they can be connected to wirelessly.

Once connected with these wires this network forms a LAN(local area network) coz it is located in a specific local area. To send data from PC 1 to PC 6 if they are in a network, the computer creates messages in packets and sends it to the switch. The switch then reads the contents of the packet and understands the destination of the package and sends it to the dest in this case PC6.



How do devices connect to the internet
To create a LAN a switch is fine. But how do devices connect to the internet. For this we use something called a router. The switch is connected to the router with the help of a copper wire. But to actually connect to the internet we use a wire provided by the ISP(internet service provider) for a given price. To send a packet to the internet, the computer first sends it to the switch then the switch sends it to the router and then the router acts like a door to the internet.
Each house or residence will have a LAN. The router helps us in connecting the computer to another computer in the world. In other words the router helps us connect two different LANS together.



What is the internet?
The internet helps connect all the LANs together and creates a network. A home router is very important, it is basically a mix of a router and a switch. This typically also has a access point feature so we can connect to it wirelessly.
So why cant there be just one router and all home routers connect to that router. Well first of all the main router will have to have millions of ports so that each device can connect to it. But the main problem is one router will have to carry all the load making it single point of failure. So in this case if there is a single problem with the router than the internet of the whole world will crash at the same time. Also long cables would be required.


These cables to connect to the internet are even laid down on the ocean floor! If one of these cables are broken it can cause the internet of that continent to break. These are all fibre optic cables coz the speed of data transmission is very high.

Say a computer from India has to send a packet to a computer in Mexico. First the router takes this packet and sends it through cables to another router. This router now has many options to pass this packet forward. To choose the best one it has something called a routing table. The routing table is developed through special algorithms which are created by the processor in the router. It them forwards this packet to the next router based on the routing table. This process of passing the packets is called forwarding. This process repeats until the packet reaches its destination.

One important thing to note is that the router always tries to take the shortest path to reach the dest. This may not be the shortest path visually but taking into account many factors like traffic etc. 
The internet is a network of networks.



Say youtube wants to transmit data to you after you send a request to it. The way it will do this is it will send packets of data to you through the internet. This sending of data piece by piece is called streaming. When we want this packet from youtube, we are actually communicating with high powered computers from youtube called servers. There are many youtube servers distributed around the world to avoid single point of failure.



WAN(Wide area network)
This is to connect two LANs together. You might be wondering then what is the difference between this and the internet. The main difference is privacy.
Assume one LAN network which is an office wants to send data to another Lan network, well if they do this through the internet then the data can be exploited because the internet is public. So if they are in a LAN then only those local computers can access it and if they are in a WAN then only the two connected LAN networks will be able to access the data as it is private.The most popular WAN network method is called VPN(virtual private network). VPN tunnelling provides a tunnel for data transmission in a public network but also gives you anonymity and is more secure. It encrypts your data packets before sending them. People generally use VPN’s to access restricted websites.



How does VPN tunnelling work?
Well the thing is since there really isn’t a physical tunnel connecting the two LAN routers, the data can still be accessed. But the data is put into a secure envelope per say just like you put a letter in an envelope, this data is then encrypted so data cant be hacked or accessed. Putting the data to be transmitted into an envelope or another packet is called encapsulation.



Since the internet is a public network, don’t you think that the data you send to networks like amazon can be hacked?
Well to some extent it can’t be hacked because of something called end to end encryption. In this system only the two communicating users will be able to see the data.



Which is the biggest WAN in the world?
The biggest WAN in the world is the internet itself. But there is a difference between the WAN connection between two offices and the internet. The internet is public and is owned by everyone in the world.


A LAN is more secure than WAN because LAN never passes over the internet but WAN even with VPN passes over the internet.




Public and Private WAN


In a private WAN you can buy a line directly from your ISP and use that private line for connection of networks. This is more secure but it can be very costly especially over long distances. That is why average companies generally prefer Public WANS

We use switches to create a LAN and routers to create a WAN. We cannot use a switch to create a WAN



What is the ISP?
The internet is made up of a connection of many different routers. The routers of the world are connected by these different ISP’s. Each ISP can control specific routers.	 ISP’s are the companies that allow us to connect to the internet. There are many different ISP’s in the world.



LOCAL ISP’S
Local isp’s are responsible for connection of LANS in a locality. These local isps then connect to the regional ISP. So we can say that different local ISPs connect together in a regional ISP. We can say that local isps connect localities like neighbourhoods and Regional ISP’s connect cities in a country. So a network of the country is formed by regional and local ISPs. Global ISPs connects different countries systems together.  

Note : some Local ISP’s can interact with global isps without regional ISPs
Local ISP’s are generally smaller companies and they sometimes may want a direct connection with a global ISP so that there customers can have a better experience

Say a computer in Belgium wants to connect to a website in India but that website has only one server. In this case the user sends a request and the packet moves through the local ISP and regional ISP and global ISP to reach the server of the website. This website then sends the response with all relevant information. The path taken by the request and response can be different as these paths are never fixed. A company like google is very different from this random company. It has servers all around the world, so that its customers can get faster speeds. But sometimes even google faces some slight problems with speed and can dissatisfy its customers. But, google has a good solution for this. This solution is peering.



In peering, googles servers establish a direct connection with our local ISP’s neglecting the need of an ISP infrastructure, This also increases the security.
So we can say that googles fast service speed is because of its distributed servers and peering infrastructure.

It is also possible for us to connect directly to a regional ISP for faster connection."	2021-08-04T15:05:43Z	Neutral
